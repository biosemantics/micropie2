Strictly anaerobic. Utilize various sugars and produce succinic and acetic acids as major fermentation end products. The major cellular fatty acids are iso-C15 : 0, anteiso C15 : 0 and C18 : 1ω9c. The major respiratory quinones are MK-10(H0) and MK-11(H0).Cells are approximately 0.4–1.5×0.9–2.2 μm. After 3 days of anaerobic incubation on GAM agar, colonies are 0.3–1.0 mm in diameter, entire, shiny and translucent with irregular or round margins. Succinic and acetic acids are produced as end products of metabolism from peptone/yeast extract/glucose broth. Positive for acid production from l-arabinose, glucose, lactose, d-mannose and raffinose. Weakly positive for acid production from d-xylose. Cellobiose, glycerol, maltose, d-mannitol, melezitose, l-rhamnose, salicin, d-sorbitol, sucrose and trehalose are not utilized. In the API Rapid ID 32A and API ZYM test systems, cells are positive for acid phosphatase, alanine arylamidase, alkaline phosphatase, α-arabinosidase, α-galactosidase, β-galactosidase, glutamyl glutamic acid arylamidase and leucyl glycine arylamidase. Negative for N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase, arginine arylamidase, arginine dihydrolase, chymotrypsin, cystine arylamidase, esterase lipase (C8), esterase (C4), α-fucosidase, 6-phospho-β-galactosidase, α-glucosidase, β-glucuronidase, glutamic acid decarboxylase, glycine arylamidase, histidine arylamidase, leucine arylamidase, lipase (C4), α-mannosidase, phenylalanine arylamidase, proline arylamidase, pyroglutamic acid arylamidase, serine arylamidase, trypsin, tyrosine arylamidase and valine arylamidase. Weakly positive for β-glucosidase and naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase. The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 49.0 mol%.</description></treatment>
