Gram-negative. Do not form endospores. Produce non-diffusible carotenoid and/or flexirubin-type pigments. Cells of some species can move by means of gliding. Chemoorganotroph. Cytochrome oxidase- and alkaline phosphatase-positive. The predominant cellular fatty acids are branched-chain saturated and unsaturated and straight-chain unsaturated fatty acids iso-C15 : 0, iso-C15 : 1, iso-C15 : 0 3-OH, iso-C17 : 1ω9c, iso-C17 : 0 3-OH and summed feature 3 (comprising C16 : 1ω7 and/or iso-C15 : 0 2-OH). The main respiratory quinone is MK-6. cells range from 0.4 to 0.5 μm in width and from 2.1 to 3.2 μm in length and are motile by means of gliding. On marine agar, colonies are 2–3 mm in diameter, circular, shiny with entire edges and reddish-pigmented. Growth is observed at 4–36 °C. Optimal temperature for growth is 25–28 °C. Growth occurs in 1–10 % NaCl, with an optimum of 2–5 % NaCl. β-Galactosidase activity is present. Flexirubin-type pigments are produced. Decomposes casein, gelatin, starch, DNA and Tweens 20, 40 and 80. Does not degrade agar, cellulose (carboxymethylcellulose and filter paper) or chitin. Does not form acid from l-arabinose, d-cellobiose, l-fucose, d-galactose, d-glucose, d-lactose, d-maltose, d-melibiose, l-raffinose, l-rhamnose, l-sorbose, sucrose, dl-xylose, N-acetylglucosamine, citrate, adonitol, dulcitol, glycerol, inositol or mannitol. Utilizes l-arabinose, d-glucose, d-mannose and sucrose, but not d-lactose, mannitol, inositol, sorbitol, malonate or citrate. Nitrate is not reduced. Hydrogen sulfide is produced. The results for indole and acetoin (Voges–Proskauer reaction) production are negative. Susceptible to ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, carbenicillin, chloramphenicol, doxycycline, erythromycin, lincomycin, oleandomycin and tetracycline. Resistant to gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, polymyxin B and streptomycin. The dominant fatty acids are iso-C17 : 0 3-OH (32.6 %), iso-C15 : 0 (25.9 %), iso-C17 : 1ω9c (12.7 %), iso-C15 : 1 (7.8 %), iso-C15 : 0 3-OH (7.0 %) and summed feature 3 (5.0 %), comprising C16 : 1ω7 and/or iso-C15 : 0 2-OH. The G+C content of the DNA of the type strain is 37.1 mol%.</description></treatment>
