Cells are 0.5–0.7 μm wide and 3.0–5.0 μm long. Nitrate is reduced, but nitrite is not reduced. Gelatin, DNA and CM-cellulose are degraded. Chitin, agar, casein, starch, carrageenan, cellulose and urea are not degraded. Acid is not produced from glucose and indole is not produced from tryptophan. Weakly positive for β-galactosidase and positive for β-glucosidase. Growth occurs at 15–37 °C and optimally at 25–30 °C. The optimal NaCl concentration for growth is 3–4 % (w/v); growth occurs with NaCl at concentrations up to 6 % (w/v). Of the 95 different carbon sources tested on Biolog GN2 microplates, only l-arabinose is utilized. Peptone, sucrose, maltose and d-raffinose are utilized when tested with the protocol of Suzuki et al. (2001). The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 43 mol%.</description></treatment>
