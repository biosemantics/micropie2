  <description>Cells are irregular cocci with a diameter of 0.7–1.8 µm, motile by a single flagellum.  Heterotrophic, strictly anaerobic.  Obligately dependent upon elemental sulfur.  Catalase-negative.  Grows with peptone, bacto-tryptone, Casamino acids and yeast extract as electron donors, but no growth on D-glucose, fructose, maltose, sucrose, D-mannitol, glycerol, methanol, ethanol, butyrate, propionate, acetate, formate, lactate, pyruvate, citrate or amino acids.  Thiosulfate, sulfite, sulfate, Fe(III) and nitrate cannot support growth as electron acceptors.  Cells are hyperthermophilic, growing between 55 and 94 ˚C with an optimum at 83–85 ˚C, and in a pH range of 5.0–8.5 (optimum 7.0) with an NaCl concentration range of 1–5% (w/v) (optimum 3 %).  Doubling time is 30 min.  The main end product of growth with peptone and sulfur is H2S (more than 20 mM); minor end products are CO2, H2 (0.05 mM), acetate (2 mM) and ethanol (3.7 mM).  Sensitive to tetracycline and rifampicin.  The G+C content of the DNA is 52.9 mol% (HPLC).  Type strain is strain OGL-20PT (=JCM 12859T=DSM 14981T=ATCC BAA-394T) isolated from deep-sea black smoker chimney debris in sediment mud at the Rainbow hydrothermal vent site at a depth of 2300 m in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of the Azores.  Unable to utilize starch or pyruvate.  Resistant to ampicillin, gentamicin, kanamycin and chloramphenicol.  Resistant to rifampicin.</description>
