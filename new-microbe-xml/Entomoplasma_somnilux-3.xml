  <description>Entomoplasma somnilux sp. nov. Entomoplasma somnilux (som.ni'lux. L. masc. n. somnus sleep; L. fem. n. lux, light; N.L. neut. n. somnilux, sleeping light, referring to the quiescent pupal stage of the host from which the organism was isolated, which precedes the luminescent adult stage). Cells are nonhelical, lack true cell walls, and are either pleomorphic coccoidal or subcoccoidal (diameter, 200 to 300 nm) or occur as short, branched or unbranched filaments.Nonmotile. Colonies on solid medium containing 0.8% Noble agar usually have a fried-egg appearance. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Arginine and urea are not hydrolyzed. Film and spot reaction negative. Does not hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Cholesterol or serum is required for growth. The temperature range for growth is 10 to 32°C; optimum growth occurs at 30°C. Serologically distinct from other Mycoplasma species. Isolated from a pupal gut of the firefly beetle Pyractonema angulata.  Pathogenicity for insects has not been determined. The genome size averages 527 MDa. The G+C content of the DNA is 27.4 +/- 1 mol%, as determined by the buoyant density method. The type strain is strain YAN-1 (= ATCC 49194).</description>
