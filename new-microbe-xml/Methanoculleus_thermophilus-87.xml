  <description>Secondary alcohols might be used as electron donor by single strains.  Most strains require acetate as a carbon source for growth, but single strains might be autotrophic.  Trypticase peptone or yeast extract stimulates growth in all strains.  The DNA G+C content is 55–59 mol%; the type strain has a G+C content of 59 mol%.  The type strain is DSM 2373T (=OCM 174T).</description>
