  <description>Mesoplasma florum sp. nov. Ultrathin sections reveal ovoid particles with a single trilaminar membrane and no cell wall. Cells pass through filters having 0.45-km pores, but most, are retained on filters having 0.22-pm pores.  Colonies on agar are umbonate. Cultures are resistant to penicillin, and no reversion to walled forms occurs in the absence of penicillin. No growth response occurs when supplementary cholesterol is added, although digitonin is slightly inhibitory to growth on horse serum-containing agar. Films and spots are produced on serum-containing media. Glucose is utilized, but mannose, arginine, and urea are not. Carotenes are not produced, nor is P-D-glucosidase. The species is serologically distinct from other Mesoplasma and Acholeplasma species. The known strains were isolated from flower surfaces; other hosts are unknown. The G+C content of the DNA is 27.3 +/- 1 mol%. The genome molecular weight is 1.05 x l09. The type strain is strain L1 (= ATCC 33453).</description>
