  <description>Strictly anaerobic.  Cells are non-motile and rod-shaped, 1.0–7 µm long and 0.5 µm wide.  In mid- to late exponential phase cultures, coccoid cells are observed (0.5–1.0 µm diameter).  Asymmetrical cell division is observed.  Hydrogen and formate are used for growth and methane production.  Yeast extract and acetate are required for growth.  Acetate, pyruvate, trimethylamine, dimethylamine, methylamine, cyclopentanol, ethanol, methanol, 1-propanol, 2-propalol, 1-butanol and 2-butanol did not support growth.  Coenzyme M stimulates growth greatly.  The temperature range for growth is 10–40 ˚C (optimum 30–33 ˚C).  The pH range for growth is 7.0–7.6 (optimum pH 7.4).  Growth occurs in the presence of 0–10 g NaCl per liter, but does not occur in the presence of 20 g NaCl per liter.  The G+C content of the DNA of the type strain is 56.2 mol%.  The type strain, SMSPT (=NBRC 105244T =DSM 22288T), was isolated from a mesophilic, granular sludge in a UASB reactor used to treat a beer brewery effluent.</description>
