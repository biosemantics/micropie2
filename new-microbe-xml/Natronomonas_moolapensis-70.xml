  <description>Cells stain Gram-negative and have varying morphologies (short rods, flat tetragonal shapes or cocci) with dimensions ranging from 0.7 to 1.7 µm.  Colonies on agar medium are red with entire edges.  Aerobic.  Motile.  Cells are oxidase- and catalase-negative using conventional testing.  Strain 4.03.5 can reduce nitrate to nitrite, but cannot utilize DMSO as an alternative electron acceptor, while strain 8.8.11T cannot utilize either nitrate or DMSO as alternative electron acceptors.  Growth occurs at pH 5.5–8.5, 25–45 ˚C and 14–36% (w/v) NaCl.  Cells lyse immediately in distilled water, and a minimum ~14% salts is required for growth.  Optimal growth occurs at around pH 7–7.5 and at 18–20% NaCl.  Capable of growing in defined media but can use relatively few substrates.  Grows best on pyruvate, and can use acetate, butanol, butyrate, ethanol, glycerol, lactate, propanol and propionate as sole carbon sources.  Incapable of utilizing alanine, arabinose, arginine, aspartate, benzoate, betaine, cellobiose, citrate, formate, fructose, fumarate, galactose, galacturonate, gluconuronate, glucose, glycine, glycolate, lactose, leucine, lysine, malate, malonate, mannitol, mannose, methanol, ribose, serine, succinate, sucrose, tartrate, threonine, urea, valine and xylose (all at 10 mM) and cellulose, chitin and starch (0.1% w/v) as sole carbon and energy sources.  Acid is not produced from carbohydrate utilization.  Negative for b-galactosidase activity and indole production.  Gas vesicles in some cells.  Sensitive to mycostatin, novobiocin, rifampicin and simvastatin and resistant to ampicillin, anisomycin, bacitracin, chloramphenicol, cycloheximide, erythromycin, kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin and tetracycline at 50 µg per mL.  The type strain is 8.8.11T (=JCM 14361T =CECT 7526T =DSM 18674T).  Isolated from Cheetham Salt Works, Geelong, Australia.  In addition to phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerophosphate methyl ester, the isolates possessed an unknown glycolipid with greater mobility than the sulfated triglycosyl diether (S-TGD) of Halobacterium salinarum.  The isolates also possessed a lipid that co-chromatographed with the phosphatidylglycerol sulfate (PGS) spot seen in the profile of Hbt.  salinarum (just below the spot of PGP-Me).  Phosphatidylglycerosulfate displayed a mobility close to that of the glycolipid S-DGD-1 of Haloferax sulfurifontis, but the two lipids are readily distinguished on the basis of carbohydrate staining.</description>
