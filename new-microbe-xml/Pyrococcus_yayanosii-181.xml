  <description>Cells are motile cocci (1–1.5 µm in diameter) with a polar tuft of flagella.  Growth occurs at 80–108 ˚C (optimum 95 ˚C) and under 20–120 MPa hydrostatic pressure (optimum 52 MPa).  No growth occurs at any temperature at pressures below 20 MPa.  Growth occurs at pH 6.0–9.5 (optimum pH 7.5–8.0) and in 2.5–5.5% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 3.5%).  Growth occurs under strictly anaerobic conditions by fermentation of simple or complex substrates.  Nitrate, sulfate and thiosulfate are not used as electron acceptors.  Yeast extract, Peptone, Tryptone, cellobiose, sucrose, starch, chitin, pyruvate, acetate and glycerol are used as substrates for fermentation.  Maltose, Casamino acids and tryptophan are not utilized.  Hydrogen sulfide is produced when elemental sulfur, thiosulfate or cystine is added to the media.  Growth is enhanced by elemental sulfur.  Urea, glutamate, gelatin, NH4Cl, KNO3 and KNO2 were not used as nitrogen sources.  The type strain, CH1T (=JCM 16557T), was isolated from an active deep-sea hydrothermal chimney at a depth of 4100 m at the Ashadze site on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (12˚ 58.4’ N 44˚ 51.8’ W).  The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 49 mol%.  Able to utilize casein, cellobiose, sucrose, starch, chitin, pyruvate, glycerol, and acetate as carbon and energy sources.  Unable to utilize maltose, casamino acids and tryptophan as carbon and energy sources.</description>
