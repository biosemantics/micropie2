  <description>Mesoplasma grammopterae sp. nov. Mesoplasma grammopterae (gramm.op’ter.i.ae. M. L. fem. gen. n. grammopterae, of Grammoptera, referring to the genus of beetle [Grammoptera sp.] from which the organism was first isolated). Cells are primarily coccoid, ranging in diameter from 300 to 500 nm. Cells lack true cell walls. Nonmotile. Colonies on solid medium containing 0.8% Noble agar usually have the appearance of fried eggs. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Does not hydrolyze arginine or urea. Agar colonies do not hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Cholesterol or serum is not required for growth, but growth in serum-free media depends on the presence of 0.04% Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan). The temperature range for growth is 10 to 37°C; optimum growth occurs at 30°C. Serologically distinct from other Mesoplasma species.  Isolated from the guts of an adult long-horned beetle (Grammoptera sp.) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), an adult soldier beetle (Cantharidae), and an adult mining bee  (Hymenoptera: Andrenidae) in Maryland. Pathogenicity for plants and insects has not been determined. The average genome size is 885 kbp. The G+C content of the DNA is 29.1 mol%, as determined by Bd, T, and HPLC methods. The type strain is GRUA-1 (= ATCC 49580).</description>
