  <description>Cells rod-shaped 1-4 µm by 0.6-1.0 µm but pleomorphic in unfavourable conditions.  Cells contain carotenoids, making colonies light red or orange.  Isolated from salted hides.  Cells lyse in less than 1.5 M NaCl.  Growth in 2 M NaCl, optimum 3.4-4-3 M.  Temperature range for growth 20-45 ˚C.  pH range for growth 6-0-8.6, optimum 7.2-7.8.  Chemo-organotrophic.  Strictly aerobic.  Nitrogen sources: Casamino acids.  Carbon sources: Casamino acids and the sugars fructose, glucose, lactose and ribose.  Gelatinase-positive, nitrates reduced to nitrites, nitrites reduced but no gas produced, end product unknown.  Does not produce indole, hydrolyse starch or produce sulphide core lipids and several unidentified glycolipids.  Possesses phospholipids: phosphatidyl glycerol, phosphatidyl glycerol methylphosphate, but only trace amounts of phosphatidyl glycerosulphate.  Sensitive to anisomycin, bacitracin, novobiocin, vibriostatic agent (0/129) and sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim.  Insensitive to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ketoconzaole, flavomycin, rifampicin, streptomycin and tetracycline.  Type strain: NCIMB 786.  Comment: NCIMB 786 was originally described (but not formally proposed) as Halobacterium cutirubrum subsp. proteolyticuvzz by Formisano (1962).  However, since its deposition in the NCIMB it has been referred to as Halobacterium salinarium.</description>
