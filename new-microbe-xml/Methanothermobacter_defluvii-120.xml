  <description>Cells curved or crooked slender rods, moderately long to filamentous, 0.3-0.5 µm wide.  Gram positive.  Nonmotile.  Cells produce fimbriae.  Strictly anaerobic.  Fastest growth between 55˚C and 65˚C.  Energy metabolism by the reduction of CO2 to CH4, with H2 as the electron donor.  Formate is also used as a substrate for methanogenesis.  Acetate is not required as a growth factor.  Capable of growth between pH 7-8.  Sulfur is reduced to sulfide.  Ammonia is the sole nitrogen source, and sulfide may serve as the sulfur source.  Habitat: anaerobic sewage sludge digestors.  The mol% G+C is 62.2.</description>
