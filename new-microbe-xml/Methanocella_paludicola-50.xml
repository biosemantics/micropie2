  <description>Cells occur singly and almost all of the cells are rod-shaped; however, coccoid cells were observed in late-exponential culture.  Cells stain Gram-negative, are non-motile and are resistant to lysis by 2% (w/v) SDS.  Methane produced from H2 and formate.  Acetate is required for growth and yeast extract supported growth.  No growth or methane production from pyruvate, lactate, acetate, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, ethanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, cyclopentanol, methanol, methylamine, trimethylamine, dimethylamine, and propionate.  Growth occurs between 25 and 40 ˚C with the optimum at 35–37 ˚C.  The pH range is 6.5–7.8; optimum growth occurs at pH 7.0.  Growth was observed in medium containing less than 1 g NaCl per liter (17 mM).  The DNA G+C content is 56.6 mol%.  The type strain, isolated from a rice paddy soil at Nagaoka, Niigata, Japan, is SANAET (=JCM 13418T=NBRC 101707T=DSM 17711T).</description>
