  <description>Mycoplasma imitans sp. nov. Mycoplasma imitans (im'i.tans. L. v. gerund imitans, imitating, mimicking, referring to the organism’s phenotypic resemblance to M. gallisepticum). Thin sections reveal oval and flaskshaped cells with a three-layer membrane and no outer wall. An attachment organelle is present. Cells pass through 450-nm-pore-size filters and through 220-nm-pore-size filters with some loss. Typical “fried-egg” colonies are formed. The organism is resistant to penicillin and thallium acetate, and there is no reversion to bacterial forms in the absence of these compounds. Cultures show a growth response to cholesterol, and growth is inhibited by digitonin. Glucose is utilized, but arginine and urea are not utilized. Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride is reduced aerobically and anaerobically. There is no production of films and spots or phosphatase activity, no liquefaction of coagulated horse serum, and no hydrolysis of esculin or arbutin.  There is hemadsorption by chicken, turkey, and duck erythrocytes and hemagglutination of chicken erythrocytes. The species is serologically distinct from other Mycoplasma species except M. gallisepticum, to which it is genetically related at a level of approximately 40 to 46%. The type strain was isolated from the turbinate of a duck with respiratory disease. The pathogenicity of this organism is not fully known, but there is evidence of ciliostasis in avian tracheal organ cultures and of embryo mortality. The G+C content of the DNA is 31.9 mol%. The type strain is strain 4229 (= NCTC 11733 = ATCC 51306).</description>
