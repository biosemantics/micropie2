  <description>Cells exhibit a tumbling motility by means of numerous flagella, predominantly inserted at one specific region of the cell body.  They are cocci (1–3 µm diameter), covered with a hexagonal S-layer lattice, and occur singly and in pairs.  Cells lyse rapidly in SDS (0.01 %) and in distilled water.  Pale-yellow, round colonies about 1 mm in diameter form on Phytagel plates.  Growth occurs at between 50 and 86˚C, with an optimum at 85˚C, between pH 5.5 and 6.7, with the optimum at around pH 6.5, and between 15 and 50 g NaCl per liter, with an optimum of 30 g per liter.  Obligately anaerobic.  Chemolithotrophic.  Uses H2 and CO2 as energy and carbon sources to produce methane.  No growth was observed on acetate, formate, methanol, monomethylamine, or yeast extract.  Ammonium was the preferred nitrogen source, but significant growth also occurred in the presence of yeast extract, tryptone, urea, glutamate, and nitrate.  Growth is stimulated by selenate, tungstate and yeast extract.  Sulfur is reduced to H2S in the presence of CO2 and H2.  Growth is inhibited by chloramphenicol (75 µg per mL) and rifampicin (25 µg per mL) but not by streptomycin, penicillin G, kanamycin or ampicillin (200 µg per mL).  The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 30.7 mol% (as determined by HPLC).  Distinguished from other Methanocaldococcus strains by comparison of whole-cell protein patterns.  The type strain, strain SL43T (=DSM 15027T=JCM 11886T), was obtained from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent chimney in the Kairei vent field on the Central Indian Ridge.</description>
