  <description>Coccobacillus with slightly tapered or rounded ends, about 0.6 µm in width and 1.0 µm in length, occurring in pairs or short chains.  Gram-positive reaction.  Cell walls are composed of pseudomurein.  The peptide moiety contains glutamate, alanine and lysine.  Galactosamine and glucosamine are present in cell-wall hydrolysates.  Cells are resistant to lysis by SDS.  Optimum temperature 37 °C.  Optimum pH 7.  Strict anaerobe.  Cells grown in rumen ¯uid medium are catalase-negative.  Grows and produces methane from H2 and CO2.  In comparison, formate is used poorly for growth and methane production.  Does not grow or produce methane from acetate, methanol, trimethylamines or methanol with H2.  Requires either acetate and/or one or more components of trypticase or yeast extract for growth.  Does not require coenzymeMor branched-chain fatty acids for growth.  Grows in medium with salt concentrations similar to sea water.  Growth is not inhibited by bile salts.  The DNA G+C content is 31 mol% (Tm).  Strain GST was isolated from enrichments of goose faeces.  The type strain is strain GST (=DSM 11979T=OCM 815T).  The GenBank accession number of its 16S rRNA sequence is U55237.</description>
