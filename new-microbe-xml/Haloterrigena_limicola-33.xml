  <description>Cells are motile, rod-shaped (0.6–0.8 x 1.8–3.6 µm) and Gram-negative.  Colonies on agar plates containing 2.6 M NaCl are red, elevated and round.  Chemo-organotrophic and aerobic.  Growth occurs at NaCl concentrations of 1.7–5.1 M, at Mg2+ concentrations of 0.005–0.7 M, at pH values in the range 6.5–9.0 and at temperatures of 30–61 ˚C.  Optimal NaCl concentration, Mg2+ concentration, pH and temperature for growth are 3.1 M, 0.05 M, pH 7.0 and 45–50 ˚C, respectively.  Catalase- and oxidase-positive.  Anaerobic growth with nitrate, arginine or DMSO does not occur.  Nitrate reduction to nitrite is observed.  H2S is produced from Na2S2O3.  Negative for indole formation.  Tween 20 is hydrolysed, but Tweens 40, 60 and 80 are not.  Negative for caseinase, amylase and gelatinase.  Glucose, sucrose, maltose, fructose, sorbose, xylose, galactose, mannose, D-ribose, lactose, mannitol and sorbitol are not utilized as carbon sources.  Pyruvate and acetate are utilized for growth.  Sensitive to rifampicin (5 µg per disc) and novobiocin (30 µg per disc).  Resistant to the following antibiotics (µg per disc, unless otherwise indicated): erythromycin (15), neomycin (30), chloramphenicol (30), ampicillin (10), norfloxacin (10), ciprofloxacin (5), streptomycin (10), kanamycin (30), tetracycline (30), vancomycin (30), bacitracin (0.04 IU per disc) and penicillin G (10 IU per disc).  The major polar lipids are the C20C20 and C20C25 derivatives of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate methyl ester and S2-DGD.  The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 61.9 mol% (Tm).  The type strain, strain AX-7T (=CGMCC 1.5333T=JCM 13563T), was isolated from Aibi salt lake in Xin-Jiang, China.</description>
