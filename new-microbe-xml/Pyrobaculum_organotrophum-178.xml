  <description>Cells are Gram-negative rods with almost rectangular ends, occurring singly and in V-, X- and raft-shaped aggregates.  Terminal spheres ("golf-clubs") appear during the exponential growth phase.  No septa formation observed.  Cells are about 0.5 µm in width.  Cells are usually between 3 and 5.5 µm long and are peritrichous flagellated (flagella up to 5 µm long, about 13 nm in width).  Often raft-shaped aggregates with up to 20 cells.  Packed cells show a grey colour.  No growth at 74˚C or in the presence of 0.8% (w/v) NaC1.  Optimal doubling time (in closed culture vessels) about 690 min at 100˚C. Strictly anaerobic.  Strictly organotrophic.  During growth, S˚, L-cystine and oxidized glutathione serve as electron acceptors.  Isolates were obtained from boiling solfataric waters in Iceland, Italy and the Azores.  The type strain is Pyrobaculum organotrophum, H10, DSM 3185, Gottingen, FRG.  Cells are insensitive against penicillin G, streptomycin, phosphomycin, vancomycin, and chloramphenicol and sensitive against rifampicin (most likely unspecific inhibition).  44-48 mol% G+C.  Lithoautotrophic growth on H2, CO2 and elemental sulfur by H2/S-autotrophy. Isopranyl ether lipids in the cell membrane.  Sulfur could not be replaced by sulfite, thiosulfate, sulfate, tetrathionate, or dimethyl sulfone.  Unable to use DL-lanthionine, fumarate, tetrathionate, dimethyl sulfone or sulfate as an electron acceptor.</description>
