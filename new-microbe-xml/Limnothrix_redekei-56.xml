  <description>a filamentous cyanobacterium, The exopolysaccharides produced by L. redekei were found to be heteropolysaccharides with protein moieties. The polysaccharide had a complex composition that contained four neutral sugars and uronic acid. FT-IR spectra demonstrated that EPS was a type of polyanionic polysaccharide that contained carboxyl and carbonyl groups. Rheological studies showed that EPS of L. redekei showed non-Newtonian, pseudoplastic shear thinning properties similar to commercial xanthan, which suggests that these may be valuable for use in pharmaceutical and food industries.</description>
