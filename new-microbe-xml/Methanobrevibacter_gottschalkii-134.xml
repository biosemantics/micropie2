  <description>Coccobacillus with rounded ends, about 0.7 µm in width and 0.9 µm in length, occurring in pairs or short chains.  Gram-positive reaction.  Cell walls are composed of pseudomurein.  The peptide moiety contains glutamate, alanine and lysine (strains HOT and PG) and may contain ornithine (strainHOT).  Galactosamine may be present at very low concentrations or absent from cell-wall hydrolysates.  Cells are resistant to lysis by SDS.  Optimum temperature 37 °C.  Optimum pH 7.  Strict anaerobe.  Cells grown in rumen fluid medium are catalase-negative.  Grows and produces methane from H2 and CO2.  Does not grow or produce methane from formate, acetate, methanol, trimethylamines or methanol with H2.  Requires either acetate and/or one or more components of trypticase or yeast extract for growth.  Does not require coenzyme M or branched-chain fatty acids for growth.  Grows in medium with salt concentrations similar to sea water.  Growth is not inhibited by bile salts.  The DNA G+C content is 29 mol% (Tm).  Strain HOT was isolated from enrichments of horse faeces.  Strain PG was isolated from enrichments of pig faeces.  The type strain is strain HOT (=DSM 11977T=OCM 813T).  The GenBank accession number of its 16S rRNA sequence is U55238.  Strain PG (¯DSM 11978¯OCM816) is a reference strain.</description>
