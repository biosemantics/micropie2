  <description>Growth occurs in media containing 1.7 to 5.1 M NaCl (optimum NaCl concentration, 3.4 to 3.9 M).  Optimum temperature, 40 to 50Â°C.  Aerobic chemoorganotroph.  Oxidase and catalase positive.  Can grow anaerobically with nitrate as an electron acceptor.  Utilizes a range of compounds as sole carbon and energy sources (glucose, fructose, sucrose, glycerol, acetate, succinate, and malate).  Produces acid from glucose, fructose, ribose, xylose, maltose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol, and glycerol.  Starch is very slowly hydrolyzed.  Indole is not produced.  Nitrate is reduced with production of gas and nitrite.  Susceptible to bacitracin and novobiocin.  Isolated from the Dead Sea.  The guanine-plus-cytosine content of the major DNA component is 62 mol%, and the guanine-plus-cytosine content of the minor component is 55 mol%.  The type strain is strain ATCC 43049.  Non-motile</description>
