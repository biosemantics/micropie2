  <description>Lobed, spherical, thermoacidophilic archaeon with a cell diameter of 1.1 µm.  The optimal pH and temperature for growth are 4.0 (range 2.0-6.0) and 80 ˚C (range 65-95˚C).  It is versatile in its nutritional requirements.  The G + C content of the genomic DNA is 42 mol%.  The major cellular lipids are calditoglycerocaldarchaeol and caldarchaeol.  The type strain of Sulfolobus yangmingensis is YMIT, which was isolated from an acidic, muddy hot spring. Grew well in modified Allen’s medium supplemented with glucose and yeast extract under aerobic conditions.  Did not grow in the same medium when supplied with an H2/CO2 gas mixture.  Nor did it grow anaerobically when sulfur was added to the Allen’s medium.  However, when elemental sulfur, FeS or tetrathionate was supplied to the medium, it grew well aerobically.  Thus the strain is able to grow chemolithoautotrophically by oxidizing sulfur.</description>
