  <description>Growth was dependent on acetate, isobutyrate, isovalerate, and 2-methylbutyrate.  Sources of the branched-chain amino acids (yeast extract, Trypticase, and vitamin-free Casamino Acids) did not substitute for any of the branched-chain volatile fatty acids required.  Yeast extract (1 g/liter) was required for the growth.  Indole or tryptophan required for growth.  Growth stimulated by PABA, pyridoxine and thiamine.</description>
