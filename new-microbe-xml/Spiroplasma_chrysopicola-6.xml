  <description>Spiroplasma chrysopicola sp. nov. Spiroplasma chlysopicola (chry.so.pi.’co.la. Gr. n. Chrysops, a genus of deerflies in the Tabanidae L. v. colo, to inhabit; N. L. adj. chrysopicola, inhabiting Chrysops spp.). Cells are filamentous, helical, and motile and lack a cell wall. Colonies on solid medium containing 2.25% Noble agar have dense centers and smooth edges (a “fried-egg” appearance) and do not have satellites. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Hydrolyzes arginine but not urea. Cholesterol or serum is required for growth. The temperature range for growth is 10 to 32°C. Optimum growth occurs at 30°C, and the doubling time at 30°C is 6.4 h. Serologically distinct from other established Spiroplasma species and putative groups. Isolated from the gut of a deerfly (Chrysops sp.). Pathogenicity for insects has not been determined. The G+C content of the DNA is 30 +/- 1 mol%, as determined by the buoyant density method. The genome size is 1,270 kbp. The type strain is DF-1 (= ATCC 43209).</description>
