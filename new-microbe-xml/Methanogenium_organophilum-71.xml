  <description>Irregular coccoid, nonmotile cells, 0.5- 1.5 µm in diameter.  In agar, smooth yellowish colonies are formed.  Cultures are easily lysed by detergents, e.g. by &lt;0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate.  H2, formate, 2-propanol, 2-butanol, ethanol and 1-propanol serve as hydrogen donors for CO2 reduction to methane.  Methanol or acetate are not used for methanogenesis.  Secondary alcohols are oxidized to ketones, primary alcohols to monocarboxylic acids.  Acetate has to be added as a carbon source for growth on substrates other than ethanol .  4-Aminobenzoate, biotin and B12 are required as growth factors, tungstate but not molybdate is needed as trace mineral.  The temperature optimum is at 30-35˚C, the maximum at 39˚C.  The pH range for good growth is 6.4-7.3.  20 g NaCl and 3 g MgC12 x 6H2O per liter are necessary for optimum growth.  Complex supplements such as yeast extract or Trypticase peptone are not required but may stimulate growth somewhat.  The doubling time of cells stimulated with the complex supplements is a round 6 h on H2 and a round 11 h on 2-propanol as hydrogen donor.  Cysteine (1 mM) and more than about 10 µM ferrous iron may have adverse effects on growth.  The DNA base composition is 46.7 mol% G+C.  Methanogenium organophilum has been isolated from marine mud.  Type strain: Methanogenium organophilum CV, DSM 3596, deposited in the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen, Braunschweig, FRG.</description>
