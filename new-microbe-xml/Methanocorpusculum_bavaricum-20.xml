  <description>Small, irregular coccoid cells usually occurring singly, &lt; 1 µm in diameter.  Flagellated and weakly motile.  Gram negative.  Cell envelope consists of a hexagonally arranged S-layer with a center-to-center spacing of the subunits of 16.0 nm.  Glycoprotein subunits with an apparent molecular weight of 94000 are found.  Strictly anaerobic and chemoorganotrophic.   Methane is produced from H2/CO2, formate, 2-propanol/CO2 and 2-butanol/CO2.  No growth and methane production observed on acetate, methylamines, methanol, ethanol, l-propanol, l-butanol and cyclohexanol.  Optimal growth temperature 37 ˚C, no growth at or below 15˚C and at or above 45˚C. Optimal pH 7.0.  Clarified tureen fluid obligately required for growth.  The G + C content of the DNA is 47.7 mol% (Tm) and 51 mol% (HPLC).  Isolated from anaerobic sediment of a wastewater treatment pond of the sugar factory in Regensburg (FRG).</description>
