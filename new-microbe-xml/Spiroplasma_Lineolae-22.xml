  <description>Spiroplusma lineolae sp. nov. Spiroplasma lineola (1in.e.o'la. M.L. n. lineola, a species of tabanid fly; M.L. gen. n. lineolae, of T. lineola, from which the organism was isolated). Cells are helical, motile filaments that vary from 200 to 300 nm in diameter. Cells lack true cell walls. Colonies on solid medium containing 3% Noble agar are small and granular and never have a fried-egg appearance. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Does not hydrolyze arginine or urea. Cholesterol or serum is required for growth. The temperature range for growth is 20 to 37°C, and optimum growth occurs at 30°C. The doubling time at the optimum temperature in M1D broth is 5.6 h. Serologically distinct from previously established Spiroplasma species. Isolated from viscera of the tabanid fly T. lineola. Pathogenicity for insects has not been determined. The G+C content of the DNA is 25 +/- 1mol%, and the genome size is 1,390 kbp. The type strain is TALS-2 (= ATCC 51749).</description>
