  <description>Cells are motile and polymorphic, showing different shapes (short rods, irregular polyhedra and ovals, 1–2 µm mean cell dimensions) when grown in MR2A liquid medium and stain Gram-negative.  Minimal NaCl concentration to prevent cell lysis is 12% (w/v).  Colonies on agar plates containing 3.9 M NaCl are red, elevated and round.  Chemo-organotrophic and aerobic.  Growth occurs at NaCl concentrations of 2.6–4.3 M, at Mg2+ concentrations of 0.1–0.7 M, at pH values in the range 6.0–8.0, and at temperatures between 20 and 50 ˚C.  Optimal NaCl concentration, Mg2+ concentration, pH and temperature for growth are 3.9 M, 0.3 M, 7.5 and 37 ˚C, respectively.  Catalase- and oxidase-positive.  Does not grow under anaerobic conditions with nitrate, arginine or DMSO.  Nitrate reduction to nitrite is observed; no gas formation from nitrate.  Nitrite is also reduced.  H2S is produced from Na2S2O3.  Negative for indole formation.  Tweens 20, 40, 60 and 80, casein and gelatin are hydrolysed; starch is hydrolysed weakly.  The following substrates are utilized as carbon sources for growth: D-glucose, D-mannose, D-galactose, maltose, sucrose, lactose, starch, glycerol, D-sorbitol, acetate, pyruvate, DL-lactate, succinate, L-malate, fumarate, L-alanine, L-glutamate and L-ornithine.  D-Fructose, L-sorbose, D-ribose, D-xylose, D-mannitol, citrate, glycine, L-arginine, L-aspartate and L-lysine are not utilized as carbon sources.  Produces acid when grown on D-glucose, D-galactose, maltose, sucrose and glycerol.  Sensitive to the following antibiotics (µg or IU per disc): rifampicin (5), novobiocin (30), bacitracin (0.04 IU), anisomycin (20) and aphidicolin (20).  Resistant to the following antibiotics: erythromycin (15), neomycin (30), chloramphenicol (30), ampicillin (10), penicillin G (10 IU), norfloxacin (10), ciprofloxacin (5), streptomycin (10), kanamycin (30), tetracycline (30), vancomycin (30), gentamicin (10) and nalidixic acid (30).  The major polar lipids are phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate methyl ester, S-DGD-1, DGD-1 and one unidentified glycolipid.  The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 55.7 mol% (as determined by HPLC).  The type strain is RO2-11T (=CGMCC 1.7738T =JCM 15772T), and was isolated from a soil sample of Rudong solar saltern in Jiangsu province, China.</description>
