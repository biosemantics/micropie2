  <file>The filamentous cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon ovalisporum was observed for the first time in Lake Kinneret in August 1994 and formed a prominent bloom from September through October. Aphanizomenon ovalisporum reappeared in diminished amounts in the summer and fall of 1995. By early October, A.ovalisporum dominated the phytoplankton, reaching a chlorophyll concentration of -20 u.g I"1 and constituting 88% of the total biomass. The bloom declined in late October, and by mid-November no filaments remained in the epilimnetic water. This species was first described in Lake Kutchuk Tchekmedje near Istanbul by Forti (1911) and characterized as a solitary, slightly curved blue-green trichome, 0.5-1 mm long, narrowing towards the ends, with cells 4-5 um in diameter, 1-3 times longer than they are wide (Table I). According to Forti's description, the heterocyst is globular or ellipsoid, 5-7 um in diameter and 8-12 um long. Ovate akinetes are 12-14 um in diameter and 18-20 um long. In Lake Kinneret, A.ovalisporum filaments were free floating, sometimes, but not always, encased in mucilage, with one or a few terminal hyaline cells. The filaments were shorter (25-400 mm) and thinner (3-4 μ m, very rarely 5 μm in diameter) than those described by Forti (1911). The length of the cells was not always well defined and varied between 5 and 10 μ m; the terminal hyaline cells were longer. At the end of the bloom, older filaments developed terminal segments of elongated colorless cells. The heterocysts and akinetes were also smaller than those reported by Forti. The spherical heterocysts, 3-5 μ m in diameter, were usually located in the middle of the trichome, but also occasionally at the tip. Akinetes were 5-10 μm in diameter and 7-15 μm long, located in the middle of the trichome, very rarely adjacent to the heterocyst, and sometimes also at a terminal position. The distance between heterocysts and akinetes varied from 20 to 60 μm, rarely 90-120 μm. When grown in the nutrient-rich BG medium, A.ovalisporum isolated from Lake Kinneret developed longer filaments and larger heterocysts and akinetes than the natural populations. In these cultures, the cells were 2-5 um in diameter and 5-8 um long; heterocyst diameter was 5 urn (Table I). The akinetes were 8-10 μm in diameter and 15-20 μm long. When inorganic N was excluded from the medium, most of the trichomes had three heterocysts and three akinetes, and inmost cases the akinetes were adjacent to the heterocysts.When grown on AKW or Lindstrom medium, in which the concentrations of nutrients are lower than in BG medium, the cyanobacterial filaments resembled those from the lake. In AKW with no added N, the trichomes developed only a single heterocyst and, rarely, one akinete. Even when growing in AKW or Lindstrom media with either inorganic (NH», NO3) or with organic N substrates (e.g. urea, hypoxanthine, guanine, lysine), trichomes bearing heterocysts and akinetes were observed. The specific net growth rate (K) of the A.ovalisporum population in the lake varied from 0.02 to 0.30 In units day-1 from August to mid-October 1994 and from 0.06 to 0.40 In units day-1 in 1995, corresponding to a doubling time of 2.3-5 days (with a maximum of 21 days) during the stationary phase in 1994, and a doubling time of 1.7-3 days in 1995. Rates of photosynthetic carbon fixation during the A. ovalisporum bloom from 12 September until the end of October 1994 were unusually high in comparison to those normally observed during this season.</file>
