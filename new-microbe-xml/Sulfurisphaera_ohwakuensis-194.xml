  <description>Exponentially growing cells are 1-2-1.5 µm in diameter.  Thin sections of cells reveal an envelope about 24 nm wide covering the cell membrane.  Facultatively anaerobic.  TA- lT is able to grow organotrophically on yeast extract or peptone.  Cells grow at 63-92 ˚C, with optimal growth occurring at 84 ˚C.  The pH range for growth is 1.0-5-0, with optimal growth around pH 2.0.  The doubling time was 5.9 h under optimal conditions.  The G+C content of DNA of the type strain is 32.9 mol %.  Isolate obtained from muddy water of an acidic hot spring of Ohwaku Valley, Hakone, Japan.  The type strain is isolate TA-lT (= IF0 15161T).  Lacking flagella or pili.  Contained core lipids calditoglycerocaldarchaeol and caldarchaeol at a ratio of 8:2.  Growth was not observed on the following single sugars or amino acids: D-glucose, D-galactose, D-fructose, D-xylose, lactose, maltose, sucrose, alanine, glutamate, glycine or histidine.  Anaerobic growth was not observed in the absence of S˚.  Addition of yeast extract to anaerobic media yielded better growth than in the absence of yeast extract.  This result suggested that TA- lT is also able to grow organotrophically under anaerobic conditions.</description>
