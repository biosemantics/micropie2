  <description>Spiroplasma leptinotarsae sp. nov. Spiroplasma leptinotarsae (lep.ti.no.tar’sae. M.L. gen. no. leptinotarsae, from L. decemlineata, the Colorado potato beetle [Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae]). Cells are filamentous with helical, spiral, or compressed coils and motile, pass through 220-nm-pore-size filters with a 1,000-fold decrease in titer, and do not pass through 100-nm-pore size filters. Cells lack true walls. Colonies on solid media containing 2.0% Noble agar are slightly diffuse to discrete and produce numerous satellite colonies. Chemoorganotrophic. Acid is produced weakly from glucose. Hydrolyzes arginine. Does not utilize urea. The sterol requirement is fulfilled by 15 to 20 mg of cholesterol per liter in a DCCM-based medium containing serum. In M1D medium optimal growth occurs at 30 to 37°C (doubling time, 7.2 h), and multiplication occurs at 20 to 41°C but not at 15 or 43°C. In DCCM medium, optimal growth occurs at 30°C (doubling time, 7.2 h), and multiplication occurs at 20 to 37°C.  Serologically distinct from other established and putative Spiroplasma species, groups, and subgroups. Strain LD-1 was isolated from the gut of a Colorado potato beetle (L. decemlineata) larva. Related isolates have been obtained from the guts of L. decemlineata and L. texana adults and larvae. Believed to be a commensal. The G+C content of the DNA is 25 +/- 1 mol%. The genome size is 1,085 kb. The type strain is strain LD-1 (= ATCC 43213).</description>
