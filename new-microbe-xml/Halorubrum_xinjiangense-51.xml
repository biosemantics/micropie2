  <description>Cells are short rods (0.8–1.2 x 1.8–2.6 µm) and Gram  negative.  Colonies on agar plates containing 25% (w/v) total salts are red, elevated and round.  Chemo-organotrophic and aerobic.  Growth occurs at 2.0–5.2 M NaCl, pH 6–10 and 10–54 ˚C, with optimal growth at 3.1–3.4 M NaCl, pH 7.0–7.5 and 40 ˚C.  Magnesium is not required for growth.  Catalase and oxidase are positive.  Anaerobic growth with nitrate, arginine and DMSO does not occur and nitrate reduction to nitrite or dinitrogen is not observed.  H2S is produced from cysteine, but indole formation is negative.  Tween 80 and starch are not hydrolysed.  Amino acids are not required for growth.  Fructose, glucose, sucrose and maltose are utilized with production of acids.  No growth or acid production is observed on mannose, lactose, raffinose, rhamnose, galactose, D-ribose, glycerol, mannitol or sorbitol.  Organic acids are not utilized.  Cells contain C20C20 derivatives of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate methyl ester, phosphatidylglycerol sulfate and sulfated mannosyl-glucosyl glycerol diether.  The G+C content of DNA is 68.0% (Tm).  The type strain is BD-1T (=AS 1.3527T=JCM 12388T), isolated from Xiao-Er-Kule Lake in Xinjiang, China.  No gas vacuoles.</description>
