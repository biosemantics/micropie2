  <description>Gram-negative.  Extremely pleomorphic, motile, occurring mainly as irregularly shaped cells (0.8–1.5 µm in diameter).  Cells grown at the highest salinities are often elongated.  Colonies on complex agar medium are 1–2 mm in diameter, smooth, circular, elevated and orange–red.  Halophilic.  Cells lyse immediately in distilled water after 2 h with 10–20 g NaCl per liter.  The NaCl concentration for growth is between 1 and 4.8 M, with an optimum at 2.2–3.4 M.  Saturated NaCl inhibits growth in liquid medium.  Growth occurs in media containing more than 5 mM Mg2+, the optimum Mg2+ concentration being between 20 and 500 mM.  The pH range for growth is 6.0–8.5, with an optimum at pH 6.5–7.0; the temperature range for growth is 25–55 ˚C, with an optimum at 42–45 ˚C.  Chemoorganotrophic.  Oxidase- and catalase-positive.  Anaerobic growth with arginine or DMSO does not occur.  Positive for indole formation.  Nitrate is reduced to nitrite.  Grows anaerobically on nitrate, with the production of gas.  H2S is produced from thiosulfate.  Starch and Tweens 40 and 80 are hydrolysed.  Gelatin is hydrolysed; casein is not hydrolysed.  The following substrates are utilized for growth: glucose, glycerol, mannose, starch, maltose, sucrose, glutamate, alanine, ornithine, fumarate, malate, pyruvate, succinate and lactate.  Arabinose, lactose, mannitol, rhamnose, sorbitol, galactose, ribose, xylose, arginine, lysine, aspartate, glycine, acetate, propionate and citrate are not utilized for growth.  Acid is produced from glycerol and maltose and, to a lesser extent, on glucose, fructose and sucrose.  Sensitive to novobiocin, bacitracin, anisomycin, aphidicolin and rifampicin, but not to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, nalidixic acid, neomycin, nystatin, penicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin or kanamycin.  The major polar lipids are the C20C20 derivatives of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate methyl ester, diglycosyl glycerol diether and sulfated diglycosyl diether.  The DNA G+C content of DNA of the type strain is 62.2 mol% (Tm).  The type strain, ZJ206T (=CGMCC 1.5347T=JCM 13917T), was isolated from a solar saltern in Zhe-Jiang Province, China.</description>
