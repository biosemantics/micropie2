  <description>Cells are gram-positive rods, about 0.5 µm in diameter and 2 to 14 µm (majority: 8 to 10 µm) long, occurring singly and in chains up to 70 (majority: up to 10) cells.  Motile by polar tufts of flagella.  String-like aggregates formed under shaking.  Greenish colonies about 1 mm in diameter formed on Gelrite plates.  Cell division by septa formation.  Bilayered cell envelope.  S-layer about 20 nm wide, SDS-soluble; inner layer about 20 nm wide, SDS-resistant, most likely a sacculus consisting of pseudomurein.  Cell surface covered with slime.  Pseudomurein composed of L-glutamic acid, L-alanine, L-lysine, L-ornithine, N-acetylgalactosamine and talosaminuronic acid.  No N-acetylglucosamine.  Core lipid exclusively 2,3-di-Ophytanyl- glycerol.  Cyclic 2,3-diphosphoglycerate present in high concentrations (up to 1.1 M).  DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the AB'B"C subunit pattern.  Molecular weights of the subunits: A = 107,000; B'= 76,000; B"= 62,500; and C = 59,000.  Chemolithoautotrophic.  Methane formed.  H2 and CO2 serve as energy- and carbon sources.  Yeast extract and bacterial cell homogenates slightly stimulate growth.  No growth on formate, acetate, methanol, methylamine, propanol, L(+)-lactate and glycerol.  S° reduced, causing cell lysis.  Growth between 84°C and 110°C (opt.: 98°C; 50 min doubling time), 0.2 and 4% NaCl (opt.: 2%), and pH 5.5 and 7 (opt.: 6.5).  No growth at 80°C.  DNA base composition 60 mol% GC.  Type strain: Methanopyrus kandleri, AV19, DSM 6324, Braunschweig, FRG (isolated from the Guaymas hot vents).</description>
