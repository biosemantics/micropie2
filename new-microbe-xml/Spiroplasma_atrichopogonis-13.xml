  <description>Spiroplasma atrichopogonis [a.tri.cho.po.go'nis. N.L. gen. n. atrichopogonis of Atrichopogon, systematic genus name of a biting midge (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae)]. Cells are filamentous, helical and motile and about 150 nm in diameter. They freely pass through filters with 450 and 220 nm pores, but do not pass through filters with 100 nm pores. The cells lack true cell walls. Chemoorganotrophic. Acid is produced from glucose and arginine is catabolized. Does not utilize urea. Serologically distinct from previously established Spiroplasma species, groups and subgroups. The type strain is GNAT3597 (=ATCC BAA-520= NBRC 100390), isolated from a pooled sample of two nearly identical species of biting midges (Atrichopogon geminus and Atrichopogon levis); the entire insects were ground up in media prior to incubation. Pathogenicity for these flies is not known. The G+C content of the DNA of the type strain is 28.8Â±1 mol%, as determined by the melting temperature method.</description>
