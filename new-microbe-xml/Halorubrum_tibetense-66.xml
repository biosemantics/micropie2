  <description>Cells are irregular rod-shaped (0.5–1 x 1.5–2.5 µm).  Gram negative.  Cells lyse in medium with less than 1.5 M NaCl.  Colonies are 0.5–1 mm in diameter, red-pigmented, smooth, circular and convex.  Haloalkaliphilic.  Growth occurs optimally at 3.0–3.4 M NaCl.  The pH range for growth is 8.0–10.5, with optimum pH 9.0–9.5.  Optimal temperature for growth is 37–40 ˚C.  Magnesium is not required for growth.  Chemo-organotrophic and strictly aerobic.  Catalase- and oxidase-positive.  Gelatin, starch and casein not hydrolysed.  Tweens 20, 60 and 80 hydrolysed.  Nitrate reduced to nitrite.  Indole not produced.  Amino acids are utilized.  Glucose, lactose, mannose, sucrose, maltose, sorbose, mannitol, starch, succinate and acetate are used as carbon sources.  Sensitive to polymycin and novobiocin and insensitive to penicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, tetracycline, ampicillin, rifampicin, erythromycin, bacitracin, neomycin and sulphafurazole.  The polar lipids are C20C20 and C20C25 diether derivatives of PG and PGP-Me with five uncharacterized minor phospholipids.  The G+C content of the DNA is 63.3 mol% (Tm).  The type strain, 8W8T (=AS 1.3239T=JCM 11889T) was isolated from Lake Zabuye (soda lake).</description>
