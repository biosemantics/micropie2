  <description>Isolated from moist soil. Strain SA cells were short rods that were 0.7 µm wide by 2.1 µm long.  The cells stained gram positive and were nonmotile.  No flagella were observed. Strain SA grew on H2-CO2, and it was also able to utilize formate in F-complex medium.  It could not use methanol, trimethylamine, and acetate as substrates.  Vitamins were required for growth, but acetate and cysteine were not.  Yeast extract and Polypeptone stimulated cell growth of strain SA.  The generation time was 24 h.  Strain SA grew at 25 to 45°C but not at temperatures above 50°C or below 15°C.  The growth was fastest at 35 to 40°C.  The strain grew at pH 6.0 to 9.0.  Growth was fastest and methane was produced most rapidly at pH 6.0 to 7.5.  Good growth was observed in basal media containing 0 to 0.1 M NaCl.  The G+C content of DNA from strain SA was 25.5 mol%</description>
