  <description>Gram negative.  Motile by means of polar flagella.  Cells are triangular flat disks in the actively growing stage that are ca. 1.0 by 0.3 µm.  Colonies are about 3 mm in diameter after 1 week of incubation at 40°C on 1.5% agar plates containing 20% salt.  The colonies are translucent, entire, smooth, orange-red, and mucous on old plates.  Chemoorganotrophic.  Growth is strictly aerobic.  Growth occurs in the presence of 2.0 to 4.5 M NaCl.  Optimum growth occurs in the presence of 2.5 to 3 M NaCl at 40°C.  The Mg2+ concentration required for growth is 30 mM in solid medium, but the optimum Mg2+ concentration is around 100 mM (in medium containing 2.5 M NaCl).  Acids are produced from various sugars (sucrose, maltose, glucose, galactose, mannose, ribose, glycerol, and fructose).  Resistant to chloramphenicol (30 µg/ml), kanamycin (30 µg/ml), and penicillin (10 IU/ml).  Susceptible to anisomycin (10 µg/ml), novobiocin (5 µg/ml), and pravastatin (10 µg/ml).  The G+C content of the DNA is 62 mol% (as determined by the thermal denaturation method).  Catalase- and oxidase-positive.  The fructose-bisphosphate aldolase is class I (EDTA insensitive).  Nonsaponifiable ether-linked phosphoglyceride lipids.  The major glycolipid is TGD-2.  Contains retinal proteins.  The type strain is strain arg-1 (= JCM 9737).</description>
