  <description>Mycoplasma auris sp. nov. Mycoplasma auris (aurâ€™is. L. gen. n. auris, of the ear, referring to the provenance of the organism, the ears of goats). M. auris is serologically distinct from all of the other Acholeplasma, Entomoplasma, Mesoplasma, and Mycoplasma species evaluated in this study. Colonies on agar have the fried-egg appearance characteristic of most members of the Mollicutes. M. auris does not catabolize glucose or mannose, but arginine is hydrolyzed. Sterol is required for growth, and urea is not hydrolyzed. Tetrazolium is not reduced aerobically. Phosphatase is produced. Serum and casein are not digested, and film and spots are not produced on equine or porcine serum-containing media. Chicken and guinea pig erythrocytes are not hemadsorbed. Growth is equally good under aerobic and anaerobic (GasPak) conditions. Very small colonies. Slight viridans-type hemolysis occurs on ovine blood agar incubated aerobically; beta-hemolysis occurs after further incubation.  Filterable through 300-nm-pore-size filters with some loss of viability but not filterable through 220-nm-pore-size filters. The G+C content of the DNA is 26.9 mol%. The type strain is UIA (= ATCC 51348 = NCTC 11731). Many other serologic types similar to strain UIA have been isolated from the ears of goats in Australia. The organism has been recovered only once in the United States. The only known habitat of M. auris is the external ear canals of goats. Pathogenicity is unknown.</description>
