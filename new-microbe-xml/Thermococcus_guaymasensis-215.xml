  <description>Coccoid archaeon with cell diameters of 1.0-3-0 µm.  Cells are Gram-positive, non-motile and occur mainly as single cells, but also as diploid forms.  Colonies are circular, convex and pale grey in colour, and colony diameters range from 0.5 to 1.0 mm after 48-72 h incubation at 70 ˚C under strictly anoxic conditions.  Chemo-organotrophic and strictly anaerobic.  Utilizes preferably proteinaceous substrates such as yeast extract and trypticase in the presence of 0.5-1.0 % (w/v) elemental sulphur.  Casein, dextrose, maltose and starch are also utilized.  The end products of metabolism on medium containing yeast extract plus trypticase and sulphur are acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, isovalerate, CO2 and H2S, whereas, after growth on dextrose or maltose plus sulphur, only acetate, CO2 and H2S are formed.  The pH range for growth is 5-6-8.1, with the optimum at 7.2.  Grows between 56 and 90 ˚C, with no growth occurring at 95 ˚C.  The optimum temperature for growth is 88 ˚C.  The NaCl range for growth is 1.0-5.0 % (w /v), with the optimum at 3.0 %.  The G+ C content of the DNA is 46.0 mol%.  Lipids are mainly represented by one phospholipid and some minor components; core lipids are characteristically archaeol and caldarchaeol compounds in equal amounts with traces of tricyclized caldarchaeol.  Isolated from marine sediments at the Guaymas Basin hydrothermal vent site (2000 m depth) in the Gulf of California.  Type strain TYST has been deposited in the DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell cultures, Braunschweig, Germany, as strain DSM 11113T and in the Japan Collection of Microorganisms as JCM 10136T.  No growth on chitin, formate, acetate, propionate, butryrate, methanol, ethanol, propanol, or casamino acids.</description>
