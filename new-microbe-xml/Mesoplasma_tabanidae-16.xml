  <description>Mesoplasma tabanidae sp. nov. Mesoplasma tabanidae (ta.ban'i.dae. M. L. fem. gen. n. tabanidae, of a tabanid, referring to the horse fly family [Tabanidae] [the organism was first isolated from a tabanid fly]). Cells are primarily coccoid, ranging in diameter from 300 to 500 nm. Cells lack true cell walls. Nonmotile. Colonies on solid medium containing 0.8% Noble agar usually have the appearance of fried eggs. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Does not hydrolyze arginine or urea. Agar colonies do not hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Cholesterol or serum is not required for growth, but growth in serum-free media depends on the presence of 0.04% Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan). The temperature range for growth is 10 to 37°C; optimum growth occurs at 37°C. Serologically distinct from other Mesoplasma species. Isolated from the gut of an adult horse fly (Tabanus abactur) (Diptera: Tabanidae) collected in Texas. Pathogenicity for plants and insects has not been determined.  The average genome size is 930 kbp. The G+C content of the DNA is 28.3 mol%, as determined by Bd, T, and HPLC methods. The type strain is BARC 857 (= ATCC 49584).</description>
