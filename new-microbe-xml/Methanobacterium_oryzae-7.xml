  <file>Methanobacterium.oryzae.pdf</file>
  <description>Round colonies, 1-2 mm diameter develop after 2-3 weeks of incubation.  Cells are 0.3-0.4 µm in width and 3-10 µm in length, non-motile and rod-shaped, occurring singly or in chains (up to 40 µm in length), depending on their growth phase.  Methanogen (domain Archaea).  Optimum temperature for growth is 40 °C with no growth occurring at 15 °C and 45 °C.  Optimum pH for growth is 7.0 with no growth occurring at pH 5.5 and 9.0. Cells are halotolerant and growth occurs in medium containing 0-25 grams per liter NaCl.  Growth substrates include H2/CO2 and formate.  No growth on 2-propanol or isobutanol.  Yeast extract is not required for growth but its presence stimulates growth.  The mean DNA G+C content is 31 mol% (as determined by HPLC).  Isolated from a ricefield soil.  The type strain is FPiT (=DSM 11106T).</description>
