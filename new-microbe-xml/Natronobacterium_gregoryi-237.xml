  <file>Rods in liquid culture, usually 0.5-1.0 x 2-15 µm.  Cells become shorter in older liquid cultures.  Gram negative.  Cells lyse rapidly in distilled water.  Nonmotile.  Aerobic.  Growth stimulated by carbohydrates.  Nitrate and nitrite are not reduced.  Gelatin hydrolyzed.  Starch is not hydrolyzed.  Sulfide produced from thiosulfate.  Alkaliphilic, requiring a pH of at least 8.5 for growth, with an optimum at pH 9.5-10.  Grows at 2.0-5.2 M NaCl, with an optimum at 3M.  Requires only low concentrations of Magnesium (&lt;10 mM), with higher concentrations becoming toxic.  Temperature range for growth 25-40˚C, with an optimum at 37˚C. C20C20 and C20C25 diethers are present.  The predominant polar lipids are the diether derivatives of phosphatidyl glycerol and methyl-phosphatidyl glycerophosphate, together with small amounts of unidentified phospholipids.  Glycolipids are not present in significant quantities.  Menaquinones are the only respiratory quinones present.  Produce MK-8, MK-8(VIII-H2), MMK-8, MMK-8(VIII-H2), DMMK-8, and DMMK-(VIII-H2).  Isolated from salterns at Lake Magadi, Kenya.   Growth stimulated by ribose, fructose, glucose, mannose, and sucrose.  Resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, and tetracycline.  Sensitive to novobiocin, bacitracin, anisomycin, ciprofloxacin, perfloxacin, norfloxacin, and coumeromycin.  The mol % G+C of the DNA is 65.0 (Tm); 63.2-65.0 (Bd).</file>
