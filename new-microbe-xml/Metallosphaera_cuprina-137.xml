  <description>Cells are irregular cocci (0.9–1.0 µm), Gram-staining negative and motile by means of flagella.  Clones on modified Allen plates supplemented with potassium tetrathionate are semi-transparent, smooth, rounded and convex with a diameter of 0.2–0.3 mm.  Clones on modified Allen plates supplemented with FeSO4 are brown, circular and flat.  Growth occurs in extremely acidothermophilic conditions with growth temperatures from 55 to 75 ˚C (optimum 65 ˚C) and at pH 2.5 to 5.5 (optimum pH 3.5).  Cells grow well in modified Allen medium containing 0–1% (w/v) NaCl and growth is inhibited by 2% (w/v) NaCl.  Aerobic, facultatively chemolithoautotrophic growth on elemental sulfur, K2S4O6, FeSO4, pyrite (or FeS) and chalcopyrite.  Chemolithoautotrophic growth is stimulated by yeast extract.  Hydrogen sulfide is not produced when grown on elemental sulfur and hydrogen under anaerobic conditions.  Organotrophic growth on yeast extract, beef extract, peptone, Casamino acids, L-tryptophan, D-arabinose, D-xylose and D-glucose; weak growth on sucrose, raffinose, L-aspartic acid, L-glutamic acid and L-alanine.  The main cellular lipids are calditoglycerocaldarchaeol (CGTE) and caldarchaeol (DGTE).  The type strain, Ar-4T (=JCM 15769T=CGMCC 1.7082T), was isolated from muddy water samples from a sulfuric hot spring of Tengchong county, Yunnan province, China.  The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 40.2 mol%.  Did not utilize D-ribose, D-fructose, D-galactose, D-mannose, or maltose as energy sources.</description>
