  <description>Entomoplasma freundtii sp. nov.Entomoplasma freundtii (fr.eun.d'ti.i M.L. gen. n .freundtii named after Eyvind Freundt, a Danish pioneer in the taxonomy and classification of mollicutes). Cells predominately coccoid in shape, varying from 300 to 1200 nm in diameter. Cells devoid of cell wall and surrounded only by cytoplasmic membrane. Nonmotile. Colonies on solid medium with 0.8% agar are granular and frequently exhibit multiple satellite forms. Chemoorganotroph. Acid produced from glucose. Hydrolyses arginine, but not urea. Serum or sterol required for sustained growth. Growth temperature range, 10-32°C;optimum growth temperature, 30°C. Serologically distinct from all other established Entomoplasma species, as well as currently described glucose-fermenting (arginine-non-hydrolysing) Mycoplasma, Acholeplasma and Mesoplasma species. Isolated from gut contents of a green tiger beetle (Coleoptera : Cicindelidae). Evidence of insect pathogenicity not determined.  G + C content, 34 +/- 1 mol%; genome size, 870 kbp. Type strain is BARC 318 (= ATCC 51999T).</description>
