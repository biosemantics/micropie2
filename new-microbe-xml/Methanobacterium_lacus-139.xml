  <description>Cells are non-motile, long (2–15 µm) rods that usually grow as filaments.  Cells stain Gram-negative, autofluoresce under ultraviolet light (420 nm) and are resistant to lysis in 0.1% (w/v) SDS or distilled water.  Surface colonies on agar are small, round and greyish white, with entire edges.  Cells are obligately anaerobic and grow as chemoautotrophs.  Grows at 14–40 ˚C (optimum 30 ˚C) and at pH 5.0–8.6 (optimum pH 6.5).  Optimal growth occurs in the presence of 0.1 M NaCl.  Growth is reduced by penicillin, vancomycin and kanamycin.  Catabolic substrates for growth include H2/CO2 and methanol+H2 but not formate, acetate, methylamine+H2, 2-propanol or iso-butanol.  Produces methane.  Vitamins, yeast extract, acetate and rumen fluids are not required but stimulate growth.  The type strain, 17A1T (=DSM 24406T=JCM 17760T), was isolated from the deep sediment of Lake Pavin, France.  The genomic DNA G+C content of the type strain, as determined by HPLC, is 37.0 mol%.</description>
