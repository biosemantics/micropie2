  <description>Mesoplasma lactucae sp. nov. Mesoplasma lactucae (1ac’tu.cae; L. fem. n. lactuca, lettuce; L. gen. n. lactucae, of lettuce, referring to the plant from which the organism was first isolated). Cells consist primarily of coccoid forms, varying in size from 300 to 500 nm in diameter, with only occasional short, nonhelical, pleomorphic filaments. Cells lack true cell walls, Nonmotile. Colonies on solid medium containing 0.8% Noble agar usually have the appearance of fried eggs. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Does not hydrolyze arginine or urea. Film and spot reaction negative. Agar colonies hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Cholesterol or serum is required for growth. The temperature range for growth is 18 to 37°C; optimum growth occurs at 30°C. Serologically distinct from previously described Mycoplasma and Mesoplasma species. Isolated from lettuce (L. sativa) collected from a retail produce market; natural habitat unknown. Pathogenicity for plants or insects has not been determined.  The average genome size is 569 megadaltons. The G+C content of the DNA is 30 +/- 1 mol%, as determined by the buoyant density method. The type strain is strain 831-C4 (= ATCC 49193).</description>
