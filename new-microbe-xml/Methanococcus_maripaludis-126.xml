  <description>Methanococcus maripaludis is a rapid growing hydrogenotrophic methanoarchaeon common in salt marshes, marine and estuarine environments.   It is obligately methanogenic; H2 and formate serve as electron donors.   Acetate, methanol and methylamines are not substrates for methanogenesis.   Alcohols including isopropanol are not substrates for methanogenesis.   All strains grow autotrophically in mineral medium.  Amino acids and acetate are frequently stimulatory for growth.   Nitrogen sources include ammonium, N2 gas and alanine.   The ability to use alanine is distinctive for members of this species.   Sulfur sources include sulfide and elemental sulfur.  Storage materials include glycogen.   It is an irregular coccus, ~1.0 µm in diameter during balanced growth.   Cells from older cultures or colonies are extremely irregular.   Cells lose integrity during Gram staining and lyse completely within 10 s when suspended in either distilled water or 0.01% sodium dodecylsulfate.   It is motile, by means of polar tufts of flagella and obligately anaerobic.   It is a mesophile, with a temperature optima of about 35-40˚C.   The pH optimum for growth is between 6 and 8.   NaCl is required for growth, with optimal concentrations of 0.5-4% (w/v).   The mol% G+C of the DNA is 33. In growing cultures, cells are slightly irregular and uniform in size, between 0.9 and 1.3 µm in diameter.  All strains grow rapidly on H2+CO2 or formate in pressurized culture tubes.   Acetate, methanol and methylamines are not substrates for methanogenesis.   All strains that have been tested are unable to utilize alcohols such as ethanol, isopropanol, isobutanol, and cyclohexanol as electron donors for CO2 reduction.   In addition to NaCl, high concentrations of magnesium salts are stimulatory or required for growth.  Selenium is stimulatory to growth, and media contain high levels of iron, nickel, cobalt, and tungstate because they required or stimulatory for closely related organisms.   Sulfide or elemental sulfur are sufficient as sulfur sources.  Cysteine, dithiothreitol and sulfate do not substitute for sulfide.   Some strains also utilize thiosulfate as a sulfur source.   Ammonium, N2 gas and alanine are nitrogen sources.</description>
