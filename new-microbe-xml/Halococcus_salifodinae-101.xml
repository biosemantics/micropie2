  <description>Cocci are 0.8 to 1.2 µm in diameter and occur in tetrads, sarcina-like packets, and irregular clusters.  Gram negative; nonmotile; aerobic.  Small colonies (1 to 2 mm in diameter after 1 week of incubation at 37°C) on complex medium at a neutral pH value are pink and circular, with undulate margins; colonies are nonpigmented at pH 9.5.  The optimum temperature is 40°C; the pH range for growth is 6.8 to 9.5.  The optimal NaCl concentration for growth is 20 to 25%; no growth occurs at NaCl concentrations below 15%.  Oxidase and catalase positive.  Grows in minimal medium containing 0.1 % yeast extract and D-galactose, L-rhamnose, D-xylose, D-arabinose, D-glucose, D-fructose, D-trehalose, D-raffinose, or glycerol as carbon sources.  Nitrate is reduced to nitrite.  Gelatin is liquefied.  Susceptible to anisomycin, aphidicolin, bacitracin, and novobiocin; slightly susceptible to chloramphenicol and tetracycline; not susceptible to ampicillin, nalidixic acid, and streptomycin.  The G+C content of the DNA is 62.1 mol%.  The main polar lipids are C20C20 and C20C25 derivatives of phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol phosphate.  Menaquinones MK-8(H2) and MK-8 are present.  Natural habitat: unknown.  The type strain is Blp, which has been deposited in the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen as DSM 8989 and in the American Type Culture Collection as ATCC 51437.</description>
