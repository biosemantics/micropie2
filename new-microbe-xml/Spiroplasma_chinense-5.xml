  <description>Spiroplasma chinense sp. nov. Spiroplasma chinense (chi.nen‘se. N. L. chinense of China, the location where the organism was first isolated). Cells are helical, about 160 nm in diameter, and motile and lack true cell walls or periplasmic fibrils. Colonies on solid medium containing 0.8 to 1.0% agar are diffuse, and there are many small satellite colonies; growth on 2.25% agar produces smaller rough or granular colonies and fewer satellite forms. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose, fructose, maltose, and trehalose, but not from mannose, xylose, rhamnoside, fucose, sorbitol, and mannitol. Weak hydrolysis of arginine occurs, and no hydrolysis of urea occurs. Cholesterol or serum is required for growth. The temperature range for growth is 25 to 37°C; growth occurs at optimum 30°C. Serologically distinct from previously described Spiroplasma species. Isolated from flower surfaces of Calystegia hederacea in Jiangsu, People’s Republic of China.  The G+C content of the DNA is 29 +/- 1 mol% as determined by the melting temperature method. The type strain is strain CCH (= ATCC 43960).</description>
