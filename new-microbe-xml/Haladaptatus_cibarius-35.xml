  <description>Cells are aerobic, Gram-negative-staining cocci or coccobacilli with a diameter of 1.0 µm, motile with a single polar flagellum.  The colonies are pink, circular with entire margins and 1.0 mm in diameter after 3 weeks of incubation on a complex agar medium (DSM medium 954) at 37 ˚C.  Growth occurs at 15–50 ˚C (optimum 37 ˚C), in the presence of 10–30% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 15 %) and at pH 6.0–8.0 (optimum pH 7.0).  Mg2+ is required for growth.  The minimal Mg2+ concentration for growth and the Mg2+ concentration for optimal growth are 5 and 20 mM, respectively.  Cell lysis does not occur in distilled water.  Positive for catalase, oxidase and indole formation.  Does not reduce nitrate to nitrite under aerobic conditions.  Gelatin and Tween 80 are hydrolysed, but starch, casein and urea are not.  Sucrose, D-fructose, D-glucose, lactose, formate and acetate are utilized as carbon and energy sources, but citrate and D-mannitol are not.  Acid is produced from sucrose and D-glucose, but not from D-fructose, citrate, lactose, formate, acetate or D-mannitol.  Anaerobic growth with nitrate, sulfate, thiosulfate or DMSO does not occur.  Sensitive to anisomycin, aphidicolin, chloramphenicol and rifampicin, and resistant to ampicillin, erythromycin, kanamycin, streptomycin and polymycin B.  The polar lipids are PG, PGP-Me and two unidentified glycolipids.  The genomic DNA G+C content of the type strain is 56.5 mol%.  The type strain is D43T (=DSM 19505T =JCM 15962T), which was isolated from Korean salt-fermented seafood made from shellfish.</description>
