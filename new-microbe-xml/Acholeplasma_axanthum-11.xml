Predominantly coccobacillary and coccoid structures with a few very short myceloid elements usually 2 to 5 um in length. Serum or cholesterol not required for growth. Horse serum agar: large colonies with clearly marked centers. Neither film nor spots produced. Hemolysis: beta hemolysis with sheep and guinea pig erythrocytes. Hemadsorption and hemagglutination: no adsorption or agglutination of sheep and human erythrocytes. Aerobic, facultatively anaerobic. Broth: strong opalescence when serum present. Light uniform opacity in media without serum. No pigmented carotenoids produced. Acid from glucose, maltose, galactose, glycogen, starch, dextrin, salicin, glycerol, and cellobiose. No acid from mannose, sucrose, mannitol, lactose, dulcitol, fructose, xylose, and sorbitol. Arginine and urea not hydrolyzed. Phosphatase: negative. Tetrazolium reduced under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.  Comments: Strains serologically distinct from A. laidlawii and A. granularum by complement fixation, growth inhibition, and immunofluorescent tests.
