  <description>Round cells, usually occurring in pairs, tetrads and clusters, about 1.0 µm in diameter.  Resting cells, such as spores are not known.  Gram positive.  Cell walls are composed of pseudomurein.  Nonmotile.  Optimum temperature, near 37˚C. Optimum pH 6.5 to 6.9.  Chemoorganotrophic and anaerobic.  Surface colonies are opaque to transluscent, effuse, circular or elliptical with entire margins and light tan.  Colonies in uncrowded roll tubes may reach a diameter of 2 mm.  Energy for growth is obtained by using one tool of H2 to reduce one mol of methanol to one tool of CH4.  Methane is not produced from methanol in the absence of H2.  Carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfate, fumarate, choline or nitrate do not substitute for methanol.  Methane is not produced from acetate, methylamines or formate with or without H2.  No growth or methane is obtained with H2 and ethanol.  Easily visible pigments are not produced and cytochromes are absent.  Carbon dioxide and acetate are required for growth.  NH4+ and one or more amino acids may be major sources of cell nitrogen.  One or more B vitamin may be required for or stimulatory to growth.  The mol % G + C is 26 (Tm).  The type strain is MCB-3 (= DSM 3091).  The descriptions for the type species and type strain are the same as the description given above for the genus.  The type strain was isolated from human feces.</description>
