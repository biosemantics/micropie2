  <description>Spiroplusma corruscae sp. nov. Spiroplasma corruscae (cor’ rus. cae. M. L. gen. n. curruscae, from Ellychnia corrusca, a firefly beetle [Coleoptera: Lampyridae], the original source of the organism). Cells are filamentous, helical, and motile, pass through filters with 450-, 300-, and 220-nm pores with a 10-fold loss of titer, and do not pass through filters with 100-nm pores. The cells lack true cell walls. Colonies on solid medium containing 2.25% Noble agar are slightly diffuse to discrete and generally without the characteristic fried-egg morphology. Chemoorganotrophic. Acid is produced from glucose. Does not hydrolyze arginine or utilize urea. Film and spot reaction negative. Does not hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. The sterol requirement is fulfilled by cholesterol.  Temperature range, 10 to 41°C; optimum temperature, 32°C. The doubling time at the optimum temperature is 1.5 h. Serologically distinct from previously established Spiroplasma species, groups and subgroups. Strain EC-l was isolated from gut of an adult lampyrid beetle (Ellychnia cormsca). Many additional isolates and strains have been isolated from the hemolymph of Ellychnia and from the gut contents and hemolymph of tabanid flies. Pathogenicity for insects is not known. The G+C content of the DNA is 26.3 +/- 1 mol% as determined by the melting temperature method and 27.0 +/- 1 mol% as determined by the buoyant density method. The type strain is strain EC-1 (= ATCC 43212).</description>
