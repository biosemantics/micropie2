  <description>Cells grow in large clusters.  Growth temperature ranges from 55-97˚C.  Optimum growth at 88˚C.  The mol% G+C is 33 (Tm).  Straight to slightly curved rods, usually 0.3-0.4 µm wide by 1-3 µm long.  Motile by bipolar polytrichous flagellation.  Gram positive.  Strictly anaerobic.  Chemolthotrophic, growing on hydrogen and CO2.  The end product is methane.  Formate, acetate, methanol, and methylamines cannot serve as substrates.  In the presence of sulfur, hydrogen, and CO2, large amounts of H2S is formed, and sulfur granules attached to the cells are visible.</description>
