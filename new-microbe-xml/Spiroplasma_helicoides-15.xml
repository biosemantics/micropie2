  <description>Spiroplasma helicoides sp. nov. Spiroplasma helicoides (he.li.coid’es. Gr. n. helix, spiral, Gr. suff. -oides, like; G L. adj. helicoides, spiral-like). Cells are filamentous, helical, and motile and lack a cell wall. Colonies on solid medium containing 2.25% Noble agar have dense centers and smooth edges, do not have satellites, and have a perfect fried-egg appearance. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Does not hydrolyze arginine or urea. Cholesterol or serum is required for growth. The temperature range for growth is 20 to 37°C. Optimum growth occurs at 32°C, and the doubling time at 32°C is 3.0 h. Serologically distinct from other established Spiroplasma species and putative groups. Isolated from the gut of a horsefly (T. abactor). Pathogenicity for insects has not been determined. The G+C content of the DNA is 26 +/- 1 mol%, as determined by the buoyant density method. The genome size has not been determined. The type strain is TABS-2 (= ATCC 51746).</description>
