  <description>Spiroplasma platyhelix sp. nov. Spiroplasma platyhelix (plat.y.he'lix. Gr. adj.platys, flat; Gr. n. helix, a coil or spiral; M. L. fem. n. platyhelix, flat coil, referring to the flattened nature of the helical filament). Cells are flattened, helical, motile filaments that vary from 200 to 300 nm in diameter. The cells lack true cell walls. Cells plated on SP-4 solid medium containing 2.25% Noble agar form perfect fried-egg colonies with dense centers and smooth edges and without satellites. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Hydrolyzes arginine but not urea. Cholesterol or serum is required for growth. The temperature range for growth is 10 to 32"C, and optimum growth occurs at 30Â°C. The doubling time at the optimum temperature in M1D medium is 6.4 h. Serologically distinct from other established Spiroplasma species. Isolated from the gut of the dragonfly P. longipennis. Pathogenicity for insects has not been determined.  The G+C content of the DNA is 29 +/- 1 mol%, as determined by the buoyant density method. The genome size is 780 kbp. The type strain is PALS-1 (= ATCC 51748).</description>
