  <description>Cells are rods that measure 0.8–1.2 x 3–7 µm and become pleomorphic under unfavourable conditions.  Cells are motile and Gram-negative.  Colonies are orange or red, smooth, circular and elevated.  Growth requires at least 1.7 M NaCl, optimally 3.0–4.3 M NaCl.  Growth occurs at 0.005–1 M MgCl2, optimally at around 0.05–0.2 M MgCl2.  The pH range for growth is 6.0–8.0, with an optimum at pH 7.0–7.7.  Chemo-organotrophic.  Grows anaerobically in the presence of nitrate.  Oxidase- and catalase-positive.  Nitrate and nitrite are reduced, and gas is produced.  Indole formation is negative.  Starch and casein are not hydrolysed.  Gelatin and Tweens 20, 40 and 80 are hydrolysed.  H2S is produced from thiosulfate.  The following substrates are utilized for growth: glucose, glycerol, maltose, glutamate, alanine, arginine, lysine, ornithine, acetate, fumarate, malate, propionate, pyruvate and succinate.  Acid is produced from glucose, glycerol, maltose and mannose.  Sensitive to norfloxacin, but not to erythromycin, neomycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, kanamycin, ampicillin or vancomycin.  The major polar lipids are C20C20 and C20C25 derivatives of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate methyl ester, phosphatidylglycerol sulfate and some unidentified glycolipids.  The G+C content of the DNA is 65.6 mol% (Tm).  The type strain, AJ2T (=AS 1.3731T=JCM 12890T), was isolated from a salt lake in Altun Mountain in China.</description>
