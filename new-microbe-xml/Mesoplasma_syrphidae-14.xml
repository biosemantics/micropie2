  <description>Mesoplasma syrphidae sp. nov. Mesoplasma syrphidae (syr’phid.ae. M. L. fem. gen. n. syrphidae, of a syrphid, referring to the syrphid fly family [Syrphidae] [the organism was first isolated from a syrphid fly]). Cells are primarily coccoid, ranging in diameter from 300 to 500 nm. Cells lack true cell walls. Nonmotile. Colonies on solid medium containing 0.8% Noble agar usually have the appearance of fried eggs. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Does not hydrolyze arginine or urea. Agar colonies hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Cholesterol or serum is not required for growth, but growth in serum-free media depends on the presence of 0.04% Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan). The temperature range for growth is 10 to 32°C; optimum growth occurs at 23°C. Serologically distinct from other Mesoplasma species. Isolated from the gut of an adult yellowjacket-like syrphid fly (Diptera: Syrphidae), a bumblebee (Bombus sp.), and a skipper (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae) in Maryland. Pathogenicity for plants and insects has not been determined. The average genome size is 905 kbp. The G+C content of the DNA is 27.6 mol%, as determined by Bd, T, and HPLC methods. The type strain is YJS (= ATCC 43706).</description>
