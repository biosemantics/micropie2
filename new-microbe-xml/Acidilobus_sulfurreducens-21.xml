  <description>Acidiphilic coccus that reduces sulfur.  Growth is anaerobic.  Cells are coccoid, 0.4 to 0.6 µm in diameter, and occur singly or in pairs.  The cell envelope contains a cytoplasmic membrane and outer S-layer.  Growth occurs over a temperature range of 62 to 89°C, a pH range of 2.0 to 5.5, and a Cl- range of 0 to 128 mM.  Optimal growth conditions are 81°C, pH 3.0, and 12 mM Cl-.  Generation time under optimal conditions is 17 h.  Growth on peptone, yeast extract, glycogen, gelatin, and lodgepole pine needle extract as carbon and energy source coupled to obligate S˚ respiration.  Ammonia is produced and excreted into culture medium.  Strict anaerobe.  Genomic DNA G+C content is 59.9 mol%.  Core lipid fraction contains GDGTs containing four to six cyclopentyl rings.  The source of isolation was Dragon Spring, Norris Geyser Basin, YNP, WY.  The type strain is Acidilobus sulfurireducens strain 18D70.  Could not utilize glucose, galactose, fructose, ribose, lactose, maltose, xylose, sucrose, arabinose, mannose, Casamino Acids, tryptone, glycerin, cellobiose, cellulose, starch, soya extract, beef extract, methane, propane, propylene, ethanol, butanol, propanol, isopropanol, methanol, acetone, butyrate, propionate, succinate, lactate, pyruvate, acetate, citrate, malate, formate, fumarate, and benzoate.</description>
