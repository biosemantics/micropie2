  <description>Cells are Gram-negative, pleomorphic flat-shaped, and non-motile.  Cells were pleomorphic, including boards (ca. 0.6 x 3-6 µm), disks, and cocci (0.5-1.5 µm).  Colonies are light red, translucent, circular, 0.6– 0.7 mm in diameter, raised or convex.  Grows between pH 7.5 and 10.0, with an optimum at pH 9.5, and between 19 and 54 ˚C, with an optimum at 45 ˚C.  Requires at least 10% NaCl for growth with an optimum 15–20%.  Is chemoorganotrophic and aerobic.  Forms sulfides from sulfur, but not thiosulfate.  Reduces nitrate to nitrite.  Produces indole.  Hydrolyzes gelatin but not starch, casein or Tween 80.  Utilizes arabinose, galactose, glucose, glycerol, raffinose, sorbitol, acetate, citrate, fumarate, lactate, malate, propionate, and pyruvate.  Sensitive to anisomycin, aphidicolin, bacitracin, erthromycin, novobiocin, rifampicin, but not ampicillin, chloramphenicol, neomycin, or penicillin.  The DNA G+C content is 63%.  The type strain is N-1311T (=CGMCC 1.2124T =JCM 12255T).  No gas vacuoles.  Strictly aerobic and never showed growth in an anaerobic medium containing nitrate, arginine, DMSO, or trimethylamine N-oxide.  Oxidase- and catalase-positive.  Did not utilize D-ribose, starch mannitol, glycine, L-alanine, L-arginine, L-asparagine, L-glutamic acid, fructose, lactose, maltose, mannose, rhamnose, sucrose, D-xylose, succinic acid, or L-lysine. Diphytanyl (C20:C20) and phytanyl-sesterterpanyl (C20:C25) moieties of phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylglycerophosphate methyl ester as major polar lipid components.</description>
