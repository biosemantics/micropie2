Pleomorphic cells are bounded by a single unit membrane. Colonies on agar have a typical fried-egg appearance. Organisms are filterable through 220-nm-pore-size membrane filters and are resistant to penicillin. Growth characteristics. Does not require sterol. Optimal growth occurs at 35 to 37°C under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. A film is produced on egg yolk agar. Metabolic characteristics. Glucose, fructose, maltose, mannose, and sucrose are metabolized; arginine is hydrolyzed; resazurin, methylene blue, and tellurite are reduced. DNA base composition. The DNA base composition is 31 mol% G+C. Habitat. Isolated from a horse nasopharynx and rabbit feces. Type strain. The type strain is strain PN525 (= NCTC 11723).</description>
