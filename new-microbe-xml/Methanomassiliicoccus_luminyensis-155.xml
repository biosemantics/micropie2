  <description>Cells are non-motile, regular, Gram-stain-positive cocci with a diameter of about 850 nm.  Methanogenic and obligatory anaerobic member of the domain Archaea.  Mesophilic (25–45 ˚C) and slightly alkaliphilic, with growth occurring with NaCl at 0.1–1.0% (optimum 1.0 %).  Produces methane from H2+methanol.  Cells lyse in 0.1% (w/v) SDS or hypotonic distilled water.  Produces methane by reducingethanol with hydrogen as the electron donor, although it cannot produce methane when hydrogen or methanol is the sole energy source.  Cannot produce methane from formate, acetate, trimethylamine, 2-butanol, 2-propanol, cyclopentanol, 2-pentanol, ethanol, 1-propanol or 2,3-butanediol, even with CO2 in the atmosphere.  The type strain, B10T (=DSM 24529T=CSUR P135T), was isolated fromhuman faeces collected inMarseille, France.  Does not grow using H2 and CO2.  The genomic DNA G+C content of strain B10T is 59.93 mol%.</description>
