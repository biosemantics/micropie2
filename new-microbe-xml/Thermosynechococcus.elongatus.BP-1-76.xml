  <description>thermophilic unicellular cyanobacterium, The most distinctive feature of the unicellular rod-shaped cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus strain BP-1 is its thermophilic character, It inhabits hot springs and has an optimum growth temperature of approximately 55â—¦ C. T. elongatus is an obligate photoautotrophic organism, pigmented with chlorophyll a, carotenoids and phycocyanobilin, and has long been used as a model organism for the study of photosynthesis. Although transformation by electroporation has been attempted in thermophilic cyanobacteria, it has been successful only in T. elongatus .</description>
