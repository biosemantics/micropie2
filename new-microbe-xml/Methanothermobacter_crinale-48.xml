  <description>Cells occur singly or in pairs as straight or slightly curved rods (0.3 µm in width and 2.2 to 5.9 µm in length) but occasionally connected to coccoid-shaped cells at the ends.  The cells are not motile, are not lysed in 1% SDS (wt/vol), and stain Gram positively.  Methane is produced from H2-CO2, and acetate is a required growth factor.  Did not grow on formate, acetate, trimethylamine, monomethylamine, ethanol, dimethyl sulfide, isopropalol, isobutanol, or 2-butanol.  Good growth occurs at a pH of 6.9 (range 6.6 to 8.9), a temperature of 65°C (range 45 to 85°C), and an NaCl concentration of 0.025 g per liter (range 0.025 to 40 g per liter). The genomic DNA G+C content is 40.121.3 or 41.1 mol%, based on the Tm or HPLC method, respectively.   The type strain of Tm2T (ACCC 00699T = JCM 17393T) was isolated from oil sands in the Haoxian central facility of in the Shengli oil field of the People’s Republic of China.</description>
