  <description>Has cells that are cocci (diameter, 0.7 to 1.4 µm) that are not motile.  Cell division occurs by constriction.  It is an obligate anaerobe and grows optimally in the presence of 20 g of NaCl per liter at a pH around 6.0.  Growth occurs from 55 to 95 ˚C, with an optimum temperature of around 88 ˚C.  It is an obligate chemorganotroph and grows preferentially on proteolysis products such as yeast, beef extract, tryptone, peptone, and casein hydrolysate, and also grows on a mixture of ten essential amino acids (arginine, aspartic acid, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, threonine, tyrosine, and valine).  Sulfur is necessary for growth.  Type strain EJ1T (DSM 15227T = JCM 11825T) was isolated from an active chimney-wall fragment recovered from Snakepit hydrothermal site on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  The isolation was performed after gamma-exposure of 20 kGy of the enrichment culture.  Able to resist doses of 2 kGy without loss of cultivability.  No growth occurred at pH 3.0 to 9.0.  No growth was detected at NaCl concentrations of 0 and 40 g per liter.  No growth was detected in the presence of thiosulfate, sulfate, and sulfite.  No growth on casamino acids, acetate, succinate, propionate, pyruvate, gelatin, sucrose, cellobiose, lactose, maltose, glycogen, xylose, and starch.  Resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, penicillin, kanamycin, vancomycin, and streptomycin.  Sensitive to rifampicin. The G+C content was 52.3 mol% (Tm).</description>
