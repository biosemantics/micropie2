  <description>Cells are irregular coccoid, about 0.7–1.3 µm in diameter, occurring singly and in pairs, sometimes in aggregates.  Strictly lithotrophic, strictly anaerobic.  Fe(II), H2, and sulfide serve as electron donors.  Reduction of nitrate leads to formation of nitrite and nitrous gases.  Reduction of thiosulfate in the presence of H2 leads to H2S.  S° inhibitory to growth.  Pyruvate, acetate, and yeast extract do not serve as electron donors for nitrate reduction, but stimulate growth.  Core lipids consist of 2,3-di-O-phytanyl- sn-glycerol and glycerol-dialkyl-glycerol.  Growth between 65°C and 95°C (optimum: 85° C), 0.5% and 4.5% NaCl (optimum: 1.8–2.0% NaCl), and pH 6.0 and 8.5 (optimum: pH 7.0).  DNA base composition 43 mol% G+C.  Type strain: Ferrogolobus placidus, AEDII12DO (DSM 10642), Braunschweig, Germany, isolated from a shallow marine hydrothermal system at Vulcano Island, Italy.  The isolate was not able to grow on various organic acids or sugars in the presence of nitrate. Organic compounds (peptone, meat extract, yeast extract, casamino acids, lactate, acetate, pyruvate, propionate, isovalerate, succinate, fumarate, citrate, glucose, and fructose) were not essential for growth.  However, casamino acids, yeast extract, acetate, and pyruvate increased final cell yields about threefold when added in addition to the electron donor and acceptor.  The isolate was not able to grow on oxygen and did not tolerate oxygen, not even at very low concentrations.</description>
