  <description>Irregular cocci, 0.75 to 1.5 µm in diameter, occurring individually and occasionally in clumps and tetrads.  Very susceptible to lysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate.  Gram stain results are negative.  Colonies in roll tubes are 0.2 to 0.4 mm within 7 days, yellowish tan, smooth, convex, opaque, and circular with entire margins.  Methylamines, methanol and other methyl group-containing substrates (but not acetate) are used for growth and methanogenesis; H2-CO2 and formate are not used.  Yeast extract, Trypticase peptone, and rumen fluid are stimulatory but not required.  Trimethylamine may serve as a sole carbon and energy source.  Grows in medium containing 0.2 to 2.1 M NaCl; optimal growth in the presence of 0.7 M NaCl.  Most rapid growth occurs near pH 9.2 and 45°C.  The guanine-plus-cytosine content of the deoxyribonucleic acid is 38 mol%. Habitat: alkaline, saline lake sediments.  Type strain: WeN5 (= DSM 4017).</description>
