  <description>Highly irregular cocci; cell width 2.6 µm.  Cells are peritrichously flagellated and have pili.  Gram nagative; sensitive to 1% SDS.  Cell wall has a periodic surface pattern.  Colony characteristics: Circular, umbonate, greenish-yellow with entire edges and a shiny surface.  DNA base composition: 52 mol % G + C.  Temperature optimum 20 – 25˚C.  pH optimum 6.8 to 7.3.  Isolated from sediment from Cariaco Trench. Fastidious anaerobe; formate or H2-CO2 serve as substrates for growth and methane production; acetate and methanol do not. Optimal growth in 0.54 M Na+; yeast extract and acetate required for growth.  Type strain: JR1.  DSM number 1497 Gottingen, FRG.</description>
