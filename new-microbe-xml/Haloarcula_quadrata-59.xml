  <description>Gram-negative.  Predominantly square-shaped, pleomorphic, flat cells, 2-3 µm, motile by means of one or more flagella.  Colonies small, entire, smooth and red orange.  Chemo-organotrophic.  Growth occurs in the presence of 2.7-4.3 M NaCl.  At least 50-100 mM Mg2+ is required for optimal growth and maintenance of the square morphology.  Optimum temperature for growth is 53 ˚C; no growth observed above 55 ˚C.  Growth occurs on glucose, sucrose and maltose as single carbon and energy sources.  Growth stimulation further observed by galactose, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol, succinate and pyruvate.  Acid is produced in the presence of glucose, galactose, sucrose, xylose or ribose.  Grows anaerobically in the presence of nitrate with formation of nitrite and gas.  No anaerobic growth in the presence of arginine.  Starch hydrolysed.  No hydrolysis of gelatin, casein, Tween 20 or Tween 80.  Indole is not produced.  Oxidase- and catalase-positive.  Polar lipids are phosphatidylglycerol, the methyl ester of phosphatidylglycerophosphate, phosphatidylglycerosulfate and a single glycolipid (TGD-2).  Susceptible to bacitracin, novobiocin and anisomycin (25 µg per mL).  Resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, rifampicin, chloramphenicol, neomycin and erythromycin (50 µg per mL).  The G+C content of the type strain is 60.1 mol% (Tm method).  The type strain, 801030/lT, was isolated from a brine pool in the Sinai peninsula, Egypt, and is deposited in the DSMZ - Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany, as strain DSM 11927T.  Lacks gas vacuoles.</description>
