  <description>Cells are Gram-stain negative, non-motile, strictly aerobic pleomorphic rods, 0.6–0.8 µm in width and 1.0–2.0 µm in length.  When grown on a complex medium of neutral pH, colonies are small, entire, translucent and convex (0.8– 2.1 mm in diameter) after 1 week of incubation at 37 ˚C and show red pigmentation.  Cells lyse in distilled water.  Grows at between 15 and 45 ˚C (optimally at 37 ˚C) and at between pH 6.0 and pH 8.0 (optimally pH 7.0).  Grows aerobically but does not grow anaerobically, even in the presence of nitrate.  Tests for nitrate reduction, the methyl red/Voges–Proskauer reaction and the formation of indole are negative.  Extremely halophilic, requires at least 15% (w/v) NaCl for growth and the optimal concentration for growth is 20–25% (w/v) NaCl.  Growth occurs at Mg2+ concentrations of 2–10% (w/v).  Catalase and oxidase reactions are positive.  Tween 80 and starch are hydrolysed, but skimmed milk, gelatin, tyrosine and xanthine are not hydrolysed.  Produces acids from raffinose, but not from cellobiose, glycerol, D-glucose, D-sorbitol, or trehalose.  Utilizes cellobiose, glycerol, D-glucose, raffinose, glutamic acid and aspartic acid, but not D-galactose, D-sorbitol, trehalose or lysine as the sole energy source.  The type strain is susceptible to bacitracin (10 µg), but resistant to chloramphenicol (30 µg), tetracycline (30 µg), ampicillin (30 µg), gentamicin (30 µg), rifampicin (30 µg), streptomycin (30 µg) and novobiocin (5 µg).  Possesses C20C20 diether core lipids.  MK-8 (91.9 %) and MK-8(H2) (8.8 %) are present.  Possesses PG, PGP-Me, PGS, TGD-2, DGD and two unknown phospholipids.  The type strain, HST01-2RT (=BCC 40029T=JCM 15759T=PCU 313T) was isolated from salt from a sample of fish sauce from Thailand.  The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 61.6 mol%.</description>
