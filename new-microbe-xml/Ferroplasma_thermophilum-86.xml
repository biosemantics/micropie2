  <description>Cells are sphere-shaped, nonspore-forming archaea, and lack cell wall.  Motility is not observed.  The diameter of the strain ranges from 0.4 to 1.0 µm in modified 9K medium containing 0.02% yeast extract and trace elements.  The temperature range for growth is from 30 to 60 ˚C, with an optimum temperature of 45 ˚C.  It grows at pH 0.2–2.5 with an optimum pH 1.0.  Strain L1T is chemomixotrophic by oxidizing ferrous iron in the presence of yeast extract under aerobic condition and reduced ferric iron under anaerobic condition.  Strain L1T is not capable of growth on the inorganic substrates or organic substrates alone.  No growth when yeast extract, peptone, glucose, sucrose, galactose, lactose, fructose, maltose, thiamine, asparagine, and tyrosine were sole energy sources.  No growth when ferrous iron, sulfide, sulfur, thiosulfate, pyrite or chalcopyrite were sole energy sources.  Major cell membrane fatty acids (&gt;5%) are: 16:0 (21.06%), 18:0 (15.96%), 18:1 &gt;9c (14.16%) and 18:1 97c (13.43%), 15:0 anteiso (10.28%).  The G+C content of DNA is 34.1% (HPLC).  The strain has been deposited within the China Center for Type Culture Collection (CCTCC) (AB 207143T).  Slightly sensitive to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, neomycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, and erythromycin.  Highly sensitive to Tetracycline.</description>
