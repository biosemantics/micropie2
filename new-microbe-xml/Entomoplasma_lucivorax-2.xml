  <description>Entomoplasma lucivorax sp. nov. Entomoplasma lucivorax (1uc.i’vor.ax. L. fem. n. lux, light; L. neut. adj. vorax,gluttonous, devouring; N.L. neut. adj. lucivorax, light devouring, referring to the predacious habit of the host insect, which preys on other luminescent firefly species). Cells are nonhelical, lack true cell walls, and are either pleomorphic coccoidal or subcoccoidal (diameter, 200 to 300 nm) or occur as short, branched or unbranched filaments. Nonmotile. Colonies on solid medium containing 0.8% Noble agar usually have a fried-egg appearance. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Arginine and urea are not hydrolyzed. Film and spot reaction positive. Does not hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Cholesterol or serum is required for growth. The temperature range for growth is 10 to 32°C; optimum growth occurs at 30°C. Serologically distinct from other Mycoplasma species. Isolated from the gut of the firefly beetle Photinus pyralis. Pathogenicity for insects has not been determined.  The genome size averages 762 MDa. The G+C content of the DNA is 27.4 +/- 1 mol%, as determined by the buoyant density method. The type strain is strain PIPN-2 (= ATCC 49196).</description>
