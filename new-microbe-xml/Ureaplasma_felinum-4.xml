  <description>Ureaplasma felinum sp. nov. Cells are coccoid or coccobacillary, but occasional filaments are seen. Gram negative. Nonmotile. Optimal temperature, 36 +/- 1°C. Optimal pH, 6.0 to 7.0. Colonies are tiny, 15 to 140 pm in diameter, and usually granular in appearance; occasionally fried-egg morphology is seen. Growth is retarded by 0.05% thallium acetate but not by penicillins. All strains hydrolyze urea with production of ammonia. Arginine and the usual carbohydrates are not metabolized. All strains examined thus far have been isolated from oropharyngeal cavities of domestic cats. The G+C content of the DNA of strain FT2-B is 27.1 mol%. The type strain is serologically distinct from the type strains of U. urealyticum, U. diversum, U. gallorale, and U. cati sp. nov. and from the unidentified ureaplasma serogroups isolated from simian, ovine, caprine, and canine sources.  The type strain, strain FT2-B (= ATCC 49229), is also genomically distinct from the type strains of the three previously established species and U. cati sp. nov. as determined by [3H]DNA-DNA hybridization and DNA cleavage patterns. The PAGE polypeptide patterns are also distinct from the patterns of these four species. We propose that strains belonging to feline serogroup SII be named Ureaplasma cati sp. nov. (ca’ ti. L. gen. n. cati, of a cat). A cloned culture of type strain F2 of U. cati has been deposited in the American Type Culture Collection as strain ATCC 49228 and in the National Collection of Type Cultures as strain NCTC 11710.</description>
