  <description>Spiroplasma clarkii sp. nov. Spiroplasma clarkii (clar'ki.i. L. gen. n. clarkii, of Clark, in honor of T. B. Clark, pioneer spiroplasma ecologist). Cells are filamentous, helical, and about 150 nm in diameter and lack true cell walls. Translational motility in early passages tends to be lost in subsequent passages. Colonies on solid medium supplemented with 0.8% Noble agar are diffuse, without fried-egg morphology. Chemoorganotroph. Acid produced from glucose. Catabolizes arginine but does not hydrolyze urea. Film and spot reaction positive. Does not hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Sterol requirement met by cholesterol or serum. Temperature range, 10 to 32°C; optimum temperature, 30°C, with a doubling time of 4.3 h. Serologically distinct from other established Spiroplasma species and from all described Spiroplasma groups. Isolated from the gut of a larval scarabaeid beetle (C. nitida). Pathogenicity for insects not determined. The G+C content of the DNA is 29 +/- 1 mol%, as determined by buoyant density, melting temperature, and high-performance liquid chromatography methods. The genome size is 1,770 kb (1,186 MDa). The type strain is CN-5 (= ATCC 33827).</description>
