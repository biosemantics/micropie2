  <description>Spiroplasma leucomae [leu.co'mae. N.L. gen. fem. n. leucomae of Leucoma, systematic genus name of the white satin moth (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae), the source of the type strain]. Cells are filamentous, helical and motile, and are approximately 150 nm in diameter. They pass freely through filters with 450 and 220 nm pores, but do not pass through filters with 100 nm pores. The cells lack true cell walls. Chemoorganotrophic. Acid is produced from glucose and arginine is catabolized. Does not utilize urea. Serologically distinct from previously established Spiroplasma species, groups and subgroups. The type strain was isolated from a fifth instar white satin moth (Leucoma salicis) larva. Pathogenicity for these moth larvae is not known. The G+C content of the DNA is 24Â±1 mol% as determined by the melting temperature method. The type strain is strain SMA (=ATCC BAA-521=NBRC 100392).</description>
