  <description>Cells are cocci with a mean diameter of 1 µm (range 0-5-1.5 µm), motile with polar flagella.  Cell division occurs by constriction.  Obligately anaerobic.  Grows optimally at 30 g per liter sea salt and pH 7.5.  At atmospheric pressure, growth occurs between 75 and 104 ˚C.  Obligately chemo-organotrophic.  Ferments protein and proteolytic products and carbohydrates, especially glucose.  Sulfur is not necessary for growth but significantly enhances final cell concentrations when grown in closed culture vessels.  Sulfur is reduced to H2S.  At low cell concentrations, under optimal conditions and at atmospheric pressure, doubling time is 0.5 h. G + C content is 47 mol %.  The type strain, AL585T (= CNCM I-2120T), was isolated from pieces of a deep-sea smoker and its covering of alvinellid tubes collected at 13˚ N at a depth of 2650 m on the East Pacific Rise.  No growth was observed in mineral medium, in the absence of a carbon source, with an H2:CO2 gas phase (80:20), with or without elemental sulfur.  Yeast extract plus peptone and brain heart infusion supported rapid and efficient growth.  Able to grow equally efficiently with peptone or glucose as carbon and energy sources.  Less efficient growth was observed with starch and maltose as carbon sources.   A small amount of growth was obtained with meat extract, yeast extract, chitin, cellobiose and a mixture of 20 amino acids.  Resistant to rifampicin, vancomycin, penicillin, kanamycin, streptomycin and chloramphenicol.</description>
