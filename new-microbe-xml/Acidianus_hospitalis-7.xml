  <description>Acidianus hospitalis W1 is the first Acidianus strain to be isolated carrying a conjugative plasmid pAH1 which is a member of the plasmid family predicted to generate an archaea-specific conjugative apparatus.  These plasmids are also integrative elements and in an encaptured state have been implicated in facilitating chromosomal DNA conjugation for some Sulfolobus species.  A. hospitalis is also a viable host for the model Acidianus alpha lipothrixvirus AFV1, a filamentous virus carrying exceptional claw-like structures at its termini which is currently the subject of detailed structural studies.</description>
