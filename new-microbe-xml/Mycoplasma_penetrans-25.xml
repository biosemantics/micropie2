  <description>Mycoplasma penetrans sp. nov. The cells are flask shaped and are divided into two compartments, one with a fine-granule appearance and the other with a coarse granule appearance. The elongated cells grow in broth cultures as chains; branching is rarely observed. The cells lack true cell walls and do not produce a cell wall when they are cultured in the absence of penicillin. On solid medium typical mycoplasma colonies are formed. Growth in broth and growth on solid media occur under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In broth cultures there is a noticeable turbidity, and a pellet is formed in the bottom of each culture tube. The cells adhere to glass and plastic surfaces. Strong hemadsorption and cytadsorption are observed with colonies on solid medium. Glucose is fermented, and arginine is hydrolyzed. Urea is not hydrolyzed. Cholesterol is required for growth. Serologically unrelated to previously described species and strains of mycoplasmas. Genetically unrelated (as determined by DNA hybridization) to mycoplasmas that have been shown previously to both ferment glucose and hydrolyze arginine. The G+C content of the DNA is 30.5 mol%, as measured by the melting point for hyperchromatic shift. The type strain is strain GTU-54-6A1; this strain has been deposited in the American Type Culture Collection as strain ATCC 55252.</description>
