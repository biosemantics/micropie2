  <description>Cylinder-shaped rods, usually between 3 and 7 µm long and 0.7 µm wide.  Motile by flagellation.  Rods often arranged in V-, X- and raft-shaped aggregates.  No true branching.  Cells with terminal spheres occur in the stationary phase.  When grown organotrophically on arsenate or on arsenate and thiosulfate with hydrogen, small black particles (width: 0.3-0.4 µm) occur on the cell surface in the stationary phase.  Packed cell masses exhibit a greyish-black colour.  Growth between 68 and 100°C and at 0 to 3.0% NaCl.  No growth at 65 and 102°C.  No growth at 3.3% NaCl.  Optimally doubling time, 81 min.  Organotrophic growth on a mixture of yeast extract, meat extract, peptone and brain heart infusion.  Organotrophically, hydrogen inhibits growth.  Hydrogen inhibition can be overcome by addition of arsenate, selenate, sulfur or thiosulfate.  Formation of realgar in the presence of arsenate and thiosulfate or arsenate and L-cysteine (H2-CO2 gas phase).  Formation of elemental selenium during organotrophic growth on selenate (H2-CO2 or N2-CO2 gas phase).  Lithoautotrophic growth by reduction of arsenate, elemental sulfur or thiosulfate with hydrogen as electron donor.  H2S is formed from elemental sulfur or thiosulfate, arsenite from arsenate.  DNA base composition, 58.3 mol% G+C.  Type strain: Pyrobaculum arsenaticum PZ6* DSM 13514, Braunschweig, Germany and ATCC 700994, Maryland, USA (isolated from Pisciarelli Solfatara, Naples, Italy).</description>
