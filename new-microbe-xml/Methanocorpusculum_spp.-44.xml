  <description>Isolated from anoxic sediments of a pond polluted with paper-mill waste water of the Syktyvkar Forest Industry Complex.  Strain MSP was represented by motile irregular cocci with a diameter of 0.3–0.6 µm.  Metabolized H2/CO2 and formate.  Did not metabolize formate, 2-propanol/CO2, 2-butanol/CO2, methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide, methanol, monomethylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, or acetate.  Motile.
