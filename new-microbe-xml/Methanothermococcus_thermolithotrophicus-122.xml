  <description>Regular to irregular cocci, about 1.5 µm in diameter, occurring singly or in pairs.  On agar, round, convex, smooth, yellowish colonies, around 1 mm in diameter are formed.  About 20 flagella are inserted at a distinct area on the cell surface.  The cells are Gram-negative, and are lysed by 2 % SDS; the cell envelope consists ofsubunits.  Optimal growth is at 65˚C with a doubling time of 55 min.  Growth takes place between 30 and 70˚C.  The optimal pH is 6.5- 7.5.  Culture is possible in the presence of 1.3-8.3 % NaCl with an optimal growth at 4 %.  Methane is only formed from H2/CO2 and from formate.  Organic material does not stimulate growth.  The DNA base composition is 31.3 mo1% G + C.  The type strain is DSM 2095 Gottingen, FRG.</description>
