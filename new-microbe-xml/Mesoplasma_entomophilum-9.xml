  <description>Mesoplasma entomophiium sp. nov. (en.to.mo’phil.um.Gr. n. entomon insect; Gr. v. phylein love; Lat. fern. adj. entomophilum insect loving). Cells are pleomorphic but primarily coccoid, varying from 300 to 800 nm in diameter. Cells lack true cell walls. Nonmotile. Colonies on solid medium containing 0.8% Noble agar usually have the appearance of fried eggs. Chemoorganotroph. Acid produced from glucose, but not mannose. Does not hydrolyze arginine, urea, or arbutin. Carotenoids are not produced when cells from l-liter volumes of liquid broth are examined. Film and spot reaction negative. Agar colonies hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Cholesterol not required, although some strains require 0.4% Tween 80 fatty acid supplements for growth in serum free media. Temperature range for growth is 23 to 32”C, with optimum growth at about 30°C. Serologically distinct from other Mesoplasma and Acholeplasma species. Isolated from gut contents of tabanid flies, beetles, butterflies, honey bees, and moths and from flowers. Apparently nonpathogenic for the insect hosts. Pathogenicity for other insects has not been determined. The G+C content of the DNA is 30 +/- mol%, as determined by bouyant density. The type strain is strain TAC (= ATCC 43706).</description>
