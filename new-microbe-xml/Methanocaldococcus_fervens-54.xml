  <description>Cells exhibit a tumbling motility.  They are regular to irregular cocci (diameter 1-2 µm) and occur singly and in pairs.  Whitish, translucent and round colonies about 0.5 mm in diameter formed on Gelrite plates.  Growth occurs between 48 and 92 ˚C, with an optimum around 85 ˚C (doubling time 20-30 min).  Growth occurs between pH 5.5 and 7.6 with an optimum about pH 6.5 and with NaCl concentrations between 0.5 and 5% (w/v) with an optimum of approximately 3%.  Obligately anaerobic.  Chemolithotrophic.  Uses H2 and CO2 as energy and carbon sources to produce methane. No growth was observed on acetate, formate, methanol, monomethylamine, or yeast extract with an N2/CO2 or H2 headspace.  Growth is stimulated by yeast extract, Casamino acids, trypticase, selenite and tungstate.  Growth is inhibited by chloramphenicol (75 µg per mL) but not by streptomycin, penicillin G, kanamycin or ampicillin (all at 200 µg per mL) or rifampicin (50 µg per mL).  DNA base composition of the type strain is 33 mol% G+ C (as determined by the thermal denaturation method).  The type strain is Methanococcus fervens AG86T, which was obtained from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent core sample from Guaymas Basin, Gulf of California, at a depth of 2003 m.  Strain AG86T is deposited in the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen as DSM 4213T.</description>
