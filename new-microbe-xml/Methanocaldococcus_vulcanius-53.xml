  <description>Cells exhibit a tumbling motility by means of three tufts of flagella.  They are cocci (diameter 1-3 µm) and occur singly and in pairs.  Pale-yellow round colonies about 1 mm in diameter formed on 'Phytagel' plates.  Growth occurs between 49 and 89 ˚C, with an optimum around 80 ˚C (doubling time 45 min).  Growth occurs between pH 5.25 and 7 with an optimum of approximately pH 6.5 and with NaCl concentrations between 6.25 and 56.25 g per liter with an optimum of 25 g per liter.  Obligately anaerobic.  Chemolithotrophic.  Uses H2 and CO2 as energy and carbon sources to produce methane.  No growth was observed on acetate, formate, methanol, monomethylamine, or yeast extract with an N2/CO2 or H2 headspace.  Growth is stimulated by selenate, tungstate and yeast extract.  Sulphur is reduced to hydrogen sulphide in the presence of CO2 and H2.  Growth is inhibited by chloramphenicol (75 µg per mL) and rifampicin (50 µg per mL) but not by streptomycin, penicillin G, kanamycin or ampicillin (all at 200 µg per mL).  DNA base composition of the type strain is 31 mol% G+C (as determined by the thermal denaturation method).  The type strain is Methanococcus vulcanius M7T, which was obtained from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent chimney on the East Pacific Rise (13˚ N).  Strain M7T has been deposited in the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen as DSM 12094T.</description>
