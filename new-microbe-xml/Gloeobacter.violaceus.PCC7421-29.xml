  <description>Lacks Thylakoids, a rod-shape unicellular cyanobacterium isolated from calcareous rock in Switzerland, obligate photoautotroph containing chlorophyll (Chl) a, carotenoids, and phycobiliproteins (phycoerythrin, phycocyanin and allophycocyanin) with a lower relative ratio of Chl a to phycobiliproteins than that of typical cyanobacteria. Gloeobacter is sensitive to strong light and its generation time is relatively long (approximately 72 hr).</description>
