  <description>Acholephma cavigenitalium sp. nov. Acholeplasma cavigenitalium (ca.vi.ge.ni.ta.li.um. L. n. cavia, guinea pig; M. L. pl. n. genitalia, the genitals; M. L. pl. gen. n. cavigenitalium, guinea pig genitals). Pleomorphic cells are bounded by a single membrane. Colonies have a typical fried-egg appearance on agar. Organisms are filterable through 300-nm-pore-size membrane filters and are resistant to penicillin. The organism does not require sterol for growth and is not inhibited by digitonin or sodium polyanetholesulfonate. Optimal growth occurs at 35 to 37Â°C under aerobic conditions. No carbohydrates are metabolized. Arginine and urea are not hydrolyzed. Resazurin is reduced, but methylene blue, tellurite, and tetrazolium are not reduced. Phosphatase is not produced. The organism is serologically distinct from all other Acholeplasma and Mycoplasma species. The DNA base composition is 36 mol% G+C. The habitat is the guinea pig vagina. The type strain is strain GP3 (= NCTC 11727).</description>
