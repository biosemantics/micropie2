  <description>Cells are Gram-negative, motile, rod-shaped (3–10 x 0.4– 1.0 µm) and become coccoid in stationary cultures.  Colonies on complex agar medium are 0.5–1.0 mm in diameter, smooth, circular, elevated and light red.  At least 1.7 M NaCl is required for growth and growth is optimal at 3.0–3.4 M NaCl.  Mg2+ range for growth is 0–1.0 M, with an optimum around 0–0.2 M.  The pH and temperature ranges for growth are 6.5–8.5 (optimum at pH 7.5) and 24–58 ˚C (optimum at 42–45 ˚C), respectively.  Chemoorganotrophic.  Grows anaerobically in the presence of nitrate.  Oxidase- and catalase-positive.  Indole formation is negative.  Nitrate is reduced without production of gas.  H2S is produced from thiosulfate.  Tweens 40 and 80 are hydrolysed.  Gelatin, starch and casein are not hydrolysed.  The following substrates are utilized for growth: glycerol, arginine, ornithine, acetate, fumarate, malate, propionate, pyruvate, succinate and lactate.  Fructose, glucose, mannose, starch, arabinose, lactose, mannitol, rhamnose, sorbitol, maltose, galactose, D-ribose, sucrose, D-xylose, glutamate, lysine, aspartate, glycine, alanine and citrate are not utilized for growth.  Acid is only produced from glycerol.  Sensitive to tetracycline, but not to ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, norfloxacin, kanamycin, ampicillin or vancomycin.  The major polar lipids are the C20C20 and C20C25 derivatives of PG, PGP-Me and S2-DGD.  The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 66.6 mol% (Tm).  The type strain, AB14T (=AS 1.3730T=JCM 12889T), was isolated from Aibi salt lake, Xin-Jiang, China.</description>
