  <description>Mycoplasma simbae sp. nov. Mycoplasma simbae (sim'bae. L.n. simba, lion; L. gen. n. simbae, of lion [in Swahili]). Morphological and physical characteristics. Pleomorphic cells are bounded by a single unit membrane. Colonies have a typical fried-egg appearance on agar. Organisms are filterable through 220-nm-pore-size membrane filters and are resistant to penicillin. Growth characteristics. Requires sterol; inhibited by digitonin and sodium polyanethol sulfonate. Optimal growth occurs at 35 to 37Â°C under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. A film is produced on egg yolk agar. Growth is not inhibited by 0.002% methylene blue in agar. Metabolic characteristics. No carbohydrates are metabolized; arginine, esculin, and urea are not hydrolyzed; methylene blue, resazurin, tellurite, and tetrazolium are reduced; phosphatase is produced. Serological characteristics. Serologically distinct from all other Mycoplasma species. DNA base composition. The DNA base composition is 37 mol% G+C. Habitat. The habitat is lion throats. Type strain. The type strain is strain LX (= NCTC 11724).</description>
