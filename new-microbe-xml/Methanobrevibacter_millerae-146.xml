  <description>Cells occur singly or in pairs or chains and are coccobacilli (0.5–1.2 µm) with rounded ends.  Cells stain Gram-positive, are non-motile and are resistant to lysis by 10% SDS.  Grows and producesmethane from H2/CO2 and from formate plus CO2.  Acetate, methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, 2-butanol, methylamine and trimethylamine are not utilized as substrates.  Requires acetate and one or more components of yeast extract and trypticase peptone for growth.  Does not require co-enzyme M or fatty acids for growth but fatty acids can stimulate growth.  Bile-sensitive.  Mesophilic.  No growth in BRN medium below 33 ˚C or above 43 ˚C; optimum temperature range for growth is 36–42 ˚C.  pH range for growth is 5.5–10.0; optimum pH is 7.0–8.0.  The maximum salt tolerance for growth is 2.6 %.  The DNA G+C content is 31–32 mol% (Tm).  The type strain, ZA-10T (=DSM 16643T=OCM 820T), was isolated from enrichments of bovine rumen contents.</description>
