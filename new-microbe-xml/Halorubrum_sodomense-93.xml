  <description>Rods that are 0.5 by 2.5 pm and motile by a tuft of polar flagella.  Gram-negative.  Gas vacuoles lacking.  Colonies small, round, convex, entire, translucent, and reddish orange.  Chemoorganotrophic; aerobic.  Yeast extract and peptone are good sources of organic nutrients.  No growth occurs anaerobically with nitrate.  The presence of starch or clay minerals (bentonite, kaolin) in the medium is essential for growth.  Requires at least 0.5 M NaCl for growth.  Optimal NaCl concentration range, 1.7 to 2.5 M at 35°C; optimal MgCl2 concentration, 0.6 to 1.2 M (in the presence of 2 M NaCl).  Fair growth occurs at 1.8 M MgCl2 and 1.7 M NaCl and at 2.5 M MgCl2 and 0.5 M NaCl.  Optimum temperature, 40°C (in medium containing 2.1 M NaCl and 0.78 M MgCl2).  Pigmented red due to carotenoids.  Bacteriorhodopsin produced in the light under reduced oxygen tensions.  Nitrate slowly reduced to nitrite.  No indole produced from tryptophan.  Susceptible to novobiocin, bacitracin, and vibriostatic agent 0/129.  Acid produced from glucose, fructose, sucrose, xylose, maltose, and glycerol; little or no acid produced from galactose, mannose, lactose, arabinose, rhamnose, ribose, or mannitol.  Starch hydrolyzed.  Oxidase and catalase positive.  Isolated from the Dead Sea.  G+C content of the type strain, 68 mol% (as determined by buoyant density).  Type strain: ATCC 33755 (= RD-26).  Presence of ether-linked lipids.</description>
