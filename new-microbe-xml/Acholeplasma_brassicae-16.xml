  <description>Acholeplasma brassicae sp. nov. Acholeplasma brassicae (bras’si.cae. L fem. gen. n. brassicae, of cabbage, referring to the plant origin of the organism). Cells are primarily coccoid, ranging in diameter from 300 to 500 nm. Cells lack true cell walls. Nonmotile. Colonies on solid medium containing 0.8% Noble agar usually have the appearance of fried eggs. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Does not hydrolyze arbutin, arginine, or urea. Agar colonies do not hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Cholesterol or serum is not required for growth. The temperature range for growth is 18 to 37°C; optimum Serologically distinct from other Acholeplasma species. Isolated from broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) obtained at a commercial vegetable market. Pathogenicity for plants and insects has not been determined. The average genome size is 1,215 kbp. The G+C content of the DNA is 35.5 mol%, as determined by buoyant density, melting temperature, and HPLC methods. Growth occurs at 30°C. The type strain is 0502 (= ATCC 49388).</description>
