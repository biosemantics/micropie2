  <description>Mycoplasma lipophilum sp. nov.: (lipoâ€™phi.lum. Gr. noun lipus animal fat; Gr. adj. philus loving; M.L. adj. lipophilus fat loving) Minute elements unresolved by light microscopy. Agar colonies. Colonies are yellow-brown, have a rough surface and assume fried-egg morphology under optimal conditions. Liquid cultures. Slight turbidity; microcolonies, both free and adherent to the glass, are formed. Film and spots. Heavy production of film and spots in liquid as well as solid media. Lipid stain. Colonies growing on agar accept lipid-soluble pigments; this is the most distinctive property of the species. Glucose. No acid produced. Urea. Not hydrolyzed. Arginine is hydrolyzed. Methylene blue is not reduced. Anaerobic or microaerop hilic. Hemadsorption. No adsorption of human, guinea-pig, chicken, or sheep erythrocytes. Hemolysis. Small, variable plaques are produced in agar overlays of guinea-pig but not sheep erythrocytes. Serology.  Unique by immunofluorescence, complement-fixation, metabolic-inhibition, and growth-inhibition tests. Pathogenicity. Unknown. Source. Isolated from human respiratory Habitat. Uncertain. Type strain. MaBy (=ATCC 27104). The characters of the type strain are the same as those given above for the species. The type strain (MaBy) does not differ from the Jones strain.</description>
