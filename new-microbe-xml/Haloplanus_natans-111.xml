  <description>Cells are 2.5–8 µm in size.  Colonies are about 2 mm in diameter after 3 weeks incubation at 37 ˚C on 2% agar plates containing 17.5–20% salt; they are translucent, entire, smooth, opaque and pinkish.  Growth occurs at 2.6–4.3 M NaCl (optimum at 3 M NaCl), at pH 6.5–8.0 (optimum at pH 7.0) and at 37–52 ˚C (optimum at 40 ˚C).  Chemoorganotrophic.  Gelatin, starch and Tween 20 are not hydrolysed.  Reduces nitrate to nitrite.  No anaerobic growth on nitrate.  Does not grow anaerobically in the presence of L-arginine.  Some strains produce indole from tryptophan.  Glucose, ribose and acetate support growth as single carbon and energy sources.  Galactose, sucrose, succinate, glycerol, glutamate and maltose are not used.  No acid is produced from sugars.  The polar lipids are diphytanyl diether derivatives of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate methyl ester, phosphatidyl glycerol sulfate and one major glycolipid that is chromatographically identical to S-DGD-1.  Poly-b-hydroxybutyrate is not produced.  Resistant to ampicillin, penicillin G, chloramphenicol, rifampicin and neomycin; sensitive to bacitracin, anisomycin and novobiocin.  The type strain, RE-101T (=DSM 17983T=JCM 14081T), was isolated from an experimental mesocosm filled with a mixture of water from the Dead Sea and the Red Sea, Israel.  Gas vacuoles present.</description>
