  <description>Mycoplasma cottewii sp. nov. Mycoplasma cottewii (cot.tewâ€™i.i. M. L. gen. n. cottewii, of Cottew, named, as proposed by R. H. Leach, after G. S. Cottew, one of the coisolators of the organism). M. cottewii is serologically distinct from all of the other Acholeplasma, Entomoplasma, Mesoplasma, and Mycoplasma species evaluated in this study. Colonies on agar have the fried-egg appearance characteristic of most mycoplasmas. M. cottewii catabolizes glucose and mannose. Arginine and urea are not hydrolyzed. Tetrazolium is reduced aerobically. Phosphatase is not produced. Sterol is required for growth. Serum and casein are not digested, and film and spots are not produced on equine or porcine serum-containing media. Chicken and guinea pig erythrocytes are not hemadsorbed. Aerobic growth is greater than growth under anaerobic (GasPak) conditions when the two methods are compared. Colonies on ovine blood agar that are incubated aerobically produce zones of viridans type hemolysis, which changes to a beta-hemolysis after additional incubation. Brown to black pigmentation, which is often intense, occurs in young, well separated colonies on thallium acetate-containing agar medium; this characteristic can be used for presumptive diagnostic identification of M. cottewii. Filterable through 220-nm-pore-size filters with some loss of viability. The G+C content of the DNA is 27.0 mol%. The type strain is VIS (= ATCC 51347 = NCTC 11732). Serologic types similar to strain VIS are common in the ears of goats in Australia and have been recovered occasionally from the ears of goats in the United States. One isolation of a strain VIS serotype has been reported from the nasal sinuses of goats. Pathogenicity is unknown.</description>
