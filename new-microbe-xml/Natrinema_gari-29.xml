  <description>Cells are motile, Gram-negative rods, 0.5–0.8 x 2.0–3.0 µm in size.  Colonies are pale orange, smooth, circular and elevated.  Growth is chemo-organotrophic.  Requires at least 1.7 M NaCl for growth (optimum 2.6–3.4 M NaCl).  Growth occurs at 0–1.0 M MgCl2 (optimum 0.1–0.2 M MgCl2).  The pH range for growth is 5.5–8.5 (optimum pH 6.0–6.5).  The temperature range for growth is 20–60 ˚C (optimum 37–40 ˚C).  Grows anaerobically in the presence of DMSO but not nitrate.  Catalase- and oxidase-positive.  Nitrate and nitrite are not reduced.  Negative for production of indole.  Casein, starch and Tween 80 are not hydrolysed.  Gelatin is hydrolysed.  L-Arabinose, D-glucose and glycerol are utilized for growth.  Does not utilize inulin, lactose, maltose, D-mannitol, D-mannose, melibiose, rhamnose, D-ribose, sorbitol, sucrose, D-xylose or citrate.  Acid is produced from L-arabinose and glycerol.  Susceptible to bacitracin (10 U), novobiocin (5 µg) and rifampicin (30 µg), but resistant to ampicillin (10 µg), chloramphenicol (30 µg), gentamicin (10 µg), kanamycin (30 µg), nalidixic acid (30 µg), neomycin (30 µg), streptomycin (10 µg) and tetracycline (30 µg).  The predominant menaquinone is MK-8.  Cells contain C20C20 and C20C25 derivatives of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate methyl ester, phosphatidylglycerol sulfate, two glycolipids and one unidentified lipid.  The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 65.4 mol%.  The type strain, HIS40-3T (=BCC 24370T =JCM 14663T =PCU 303T), was isolated from fermented fish sauce in Thailand.</description>
