  <description>Spiroplasma tabanidicola sp. nov. Spiroplasma tabanidicola (ta.ba.ni.di’co.la. M. L. n. Tabanidae, family name for horseflies; L. v. colo, to inhabit; M. L. n. tabanidicola, an inhabitant of horseflies). Cells are filamentous, helical, and motile and lack a cell wall. Colonies on solid medium containing 3% Noble agar are uneven and granular with dense centers and irregular edges, do not have satellites, and never have a fried-egg appearance. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Does not hydrolyze arginine or urea. Cholesterol or serum is required for growth. The temperature range for growth is 10 to 37°C. Optimum growth occurs at 30°C, and the doubling time at 30°C is 3.0 h. Serologically distinct from other established Spiroplasma species and putative groups. Isolated from the gut of a horsefly belonging to the Tabanus abdominalis-limbatinevris complex. Pathogenicity for insects has not been determined. The G+C content of the DNA is 26 +/- 1mol%, as determined by the buoyant density method.  The genome size is 1,375 kbp. The type strain is TAUS-1 (= ATCC 51747).</description>
