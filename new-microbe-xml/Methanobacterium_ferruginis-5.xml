  <description>Cells are non-motile, Gram-staining-variable rods, 0.3 µm wide and 2.3–3.7 µm long, and are not lysed by 0.01% SDS or hypotonic solution (distilled water).  White colonies are formed on solid medium.  Strictly anaerobic.  H2 is used for growth and methane production, but formate, acetate, methanol, methylamine and ethanol are not.  Methane is produced from 2-propanol, isobutanol and cyclopentanol, but growth is not observed.  Vitamins are essential for growth, but acetate is not.  Grows at 20–45 ˚C (optimum 40 ˚C), at pH 5.5–9.0 (optimum pH 6.0–8.0) and with 0–1.2 M NaCl (optimum 0.34 M NaCl).  The type strain, Mic6c05T (=NBRC 105197T=DSM 21974T), was isolated from an iron-corrosive tubercle on an interior pipe transporting natural-gas-containing brine in the southern Kanto gas field, Japan.  The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 37.6 mol%.</description>
