  <description>Spiroplasma gladiatoris sp. nov. Spiroplasma gladiatoris (gla.di.a’to.ris. M. L. gen. n. gladiatoris, reflecting the initial isolation of the organism from the horsefly T. gladiator). Cells are filamentous, helical, and motile and lack a cell wall. Colonies on solid medium containing 3% Noble agar are granular with dense centers and diffuse edges, do not have satellites, and never have a fried-egg appearance. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Does not hydrolyze arginine or urea. Cholesterol or serum is not required for growth. The temperature range for growth is 15 to 37°C. Optimum growth occurs at 30 to 32”C, and the doubling time at 30 to 32°C is 4.1 h. Serologically distinct from other established Spiroplasma species and putative groups. Isolated from the gut of a horsefly (T. gladiator). Pathogenicity for insects has not been determined. The G+C content of the DNA is 26 +/- 1 mol%, as determined by the buoyant density method. The genome size has not been determined. The type strain is TG-1 (= ATCC 43525).</description>
