  <description>Cells are gram-negative, irregular cocci which occur singly or in pairs, with an average diameter of 1.0 to 1.3 µm; spores are not formed.  Electron micrographs reveal occasional internal membrane components.  Colonies in agar tubes are beige and circular with entire edges.  Either formate or hydrogen and carbon dioxide can serve as a growth substrate.  Neither growth nor methane production was detected within 2 weeks when the H electron donor was replaced by ethanol, methanol, acetate, propionate, or pyruvate.  The organism requires Trypticase and a trace vitamin solution.  The temperature for optimum growth is 55°C.  The pH for optimum growth is 7.0.  The sodium ion concentration for optimum growth is 0.25 M.  The DNA base composition is 59 mol% G+C.  Isolated from sediment underlying the high temperature effluent channel of the Crystal River Nuclear Power Plant, Florida Power Company, Crystal River, Fla.  Type strain: CR-1 (= ATCC 33837 = DSM 2373).</description>
