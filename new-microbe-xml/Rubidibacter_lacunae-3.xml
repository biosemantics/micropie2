  <description>Unicellular marine cyanobacterium isolated from surface seawater in Chuuk Lagoon, Micronesia. Maroon colored rod-shaped cells 2.5-4.7µm in length and 0.9-1.5µm in width. Requires seawater for growth. Growth occurs between 25-35°C with optimum growth at 30°C, and in concentrations of sea salts between 2-7% (optimum at 5%). Utilizes ammonia, nitrate, and urea as sole nitrogen sources. G+C content of 60.5 mol %. 16S rRNA sequence relates this organism to the members of the 'Halothece' cluster, but lies under a different genus due to similarity in sequence of only 90.7-92.1%. Contains phycoerythrin, and dominant carotenoid pigments are zeaxanthin, ß-carotene and echinenone.</description>
