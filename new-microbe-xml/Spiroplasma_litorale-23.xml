  <description>Spiroplasma litorale sp. nov. Spiroplasma litorale (1i.to.ra'le. L. neut. adj. litorale, of the shore or coastal area). Cells are filamentous, helical, and motile, vary from 200 to 300 nm in diameter, and lack true cell walls. Colonies on solid medium containing 2.25% Noble agar are granular with dense centers, uneven margins, and multiple satellites and never have a fried-egg appearance. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Hydrolyzes neither arginine nor urea. Cholesterol or serum is required for growth. The temperature range for growth is 10 to 41°C, with optimum growth occurring at 32°C. The doubling time in M1D medium at the optimum temperature is 1.6 h. Serologically distinct from previously established Spiroplasma species. Isolated from the gut of T. nigrovittatus (Diptera: Tabanidae). Pathogenicity for insects has not been determined. The G+C content of the DNA is 25 +/- 1mol%, as determined by the buoyant density method. The genome size is 1,370 kbp. The type strain is TN-1 (=ATCC 43211).</description>
