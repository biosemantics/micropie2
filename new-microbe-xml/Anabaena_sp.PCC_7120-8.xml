  <description>Anabaena species are filamentous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, which synthesize siderophores such as schizokinen and anachelin [3–5]. Iron starvation leads to oxidative stress in Anabaena [6]. A large gene cluster involved in siderophore synthesis was identified in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 (hereafter referred to as Anabaena 7120) [7]. A proteomic study of the outer membrane in this cyanobacterium also revealed the presence of predicted receptors for the siderophore–Fe3+ complex. One of the proteins Alr0397 (SchT) was shown to be the TonB-dependent schizokinen transporter up-regulated under iron-deficient conditions.</description>
