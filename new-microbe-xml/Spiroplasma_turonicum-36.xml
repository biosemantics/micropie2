  <description>Spiroplasma turonicum (tu.ro.ni.cum. L. neut. adj. turonicum of Touraine, the province in France from which the organism was first isolated). Cells are motile helical filaments, 100-150 nm in diameter, with a helix-turn of 0.56 nm, and lack a true cell wall. Colonies on solid SP-4 medium containing 3 % Noble agar exhibit a 'cauliflower-like' appearance, never appearing as ' fried eggs '. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Does not hydrolyze arginine or urea. Cholesterol or serum not required for growth. Growth was observed from 25 to 37°C, with optimal growth at 30°C. Serogically distinct from previously described Spiroplasma species. Isolated from a Haematopota fly. The G + C content of the DNA is 25 +/- 1 mol%, as determined by buoyant density. The genome size is 1305 kbp. The type strain is Tab4c ( = ATCC 70027l).</description>
