  <description>Isolated from water and mud (brown clay) from the terrestrial hot spring surrounded with ferric oxide deposits, Moutnovsky area.  Cells were long, straight rods, 5.0 x 0.5 µm in size.  Grew optimally at 80-85˚C and pH 5.0-5.5.  Growth was supported by different fermentable substrates, peptone and yeast extract supporting the best growth.  Thiosulfate and elemental sulfur stimulated the growth and were reduced to hydrogen sulfide.</description>
