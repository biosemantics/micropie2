  <description>Cells are pleomorphic, flat-shaped and uniformly stain Gram-negative.  Non-motile.  Growth occurs in media containing 12-25% NaCl, with an optimum at 22.5% NaCl.  Growth is between pH 8.0 and pH 11.0, with an optimum at pH 9.5.  Amino acids are utilized.  Growth is stimulated by glucose, fructose, maltose, sucrose and lactose.  Indole is formed from tryptophan.  Starch and casein are not hydrolysed.  H2S is not produced from thiosulfate.  Gelatin is not liquefied.  Tween 40, 60 and 80 are not hydrolysed.  The polar lipids are C20-C25 derivatives of PG, PGP and two uncharacterized minor phospholipids.  The G + C content of the DNA is 59.9 mol%.  Type strain is A33T, deposited as AS 1.1984.  (AS; Academia Sinica, China General Microbiological Culture Collection Centre, Zhong-guancun, Beijing 100080, China).  Does not reduce nitrate.  Catalase- and oxidase-positive.  Growth stimulated by acetate, glucose, fructose, and sucrose.  Growth not stimulated by mannitol.  Sensitive to erythromycin.</description>
