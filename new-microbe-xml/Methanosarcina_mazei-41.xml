  <description>Isolated from Tundra wetland soil.  Had a characteristic sarcina-like cell arrangement and morphology.  The cells of all these strains formed aggregates of varying size.  The cell aggregates were large, reaching up to 1 mm in diameter.  Metabolized a wide variety of substrates including H2/CO2, methanol, monomethylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, and acetate.  Did not metabolize formate, 2-propanol/CO2, 2-butanol/CO2, methanethiol, or dimethyl sulfide.  Non-motile.  Temperature range 5-40˚C, with temperature optimum of 35˚C.</description>
