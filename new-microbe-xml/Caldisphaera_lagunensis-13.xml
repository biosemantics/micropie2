  <description>Grows anaerobically and tolerates low levels of oxygen (up to 2 %).  Heterotrophic.  Growth occurs at 45–80 ˚C and pH 2.3–5.4.  Under optimal growth conditions, doubling time is 5 h.  Growth occurs at low salinity (&lt;1.5% NaCl).  Chemo-organotrophic; utilizes starch, glycogen, gelatin, beef extract, yeast extract and peptone as carbon and energy sources.  Forms acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, butyrate, isovalerate, H2 and CO2 as metabolic products.  Growth is stimulated by the presence of sulfur.  Hydrogen sulfide is formed.  DNA G+C content is 31 mol%.  The type strain is IC-154T (=JCM 11604T=MCC-UPLB 1331T=ANMR 0165T).  Reference strains are IC-158 (=ANMR 0169), IC-163 (=JCM11605=MCC-UPLB 1332 =ANMR 0174) and IC-165 (=ANMR 0176).  Isolated from a hot spring on Mt Maquiling, Laguna, the Philippines.  Could not grow autotrophically.  Could not use arabinose, fructose, galactose, glucose, lactose, maltose, mannose, ribose, sucrose, xylose, acetate, butyrate, citrate, formate, fumarate, lactate, malate, propionate, pyruvate, succinate, methanol, formamide, methylamine, or trimethylamine.  Growth not promoted by thiosulfate, cystine, glutathione, malate, nitrate, or Fe(III).  Sensitive to erythromycin, novobiocin and rifampicin.  Resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, oleandomycin, streptomycin, and vancomycin.  Core lipid fractions contained cyclic and acyclic tetraethers.</description>
