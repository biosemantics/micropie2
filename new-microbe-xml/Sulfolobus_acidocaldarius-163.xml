  <description>Cell size 0.8-1.0 µm and little size variation is seen.  Morphology being lobed spheres.  When growing on sulfur, both in nature and in the laboratory, Sulfolobus cells are often seen attached to sulfur crystals, either singly or in large numbers.  Highly resistant to ristocentin and vanomycin.  Sensitive to novobiocin.  Temperature range 55-80˚C.  Optimal temperature 70-75˚C.  The pH range is 1-5.9, the optimal pH being between 2 and 3.  The DNA base composition was 61 mol% G+C.  Grows on elemental sulfur as a sole energy source.  Also grows on yeast extract.  Growth on sulfur was stimulated by adding CO2.  Oxidation of elemental sulfur occurred as indicated by sulfate production and a drop in pH of the culture.  Growth was always better on sulfur plus yeast extract than on sulfur alone.  Grew on media containing yeast extract, tryptone, peptone, Casamino acids, or casein hydrolysate.  Used alanine, glutamate, aspartate, sucrose, ribose, and glutamine as sole sources of carbon and energy.  Isolated from acid thermal soils and acid hot springs in Yellowstone National Park, El Salvador, Dominica, and Italy.</description>
