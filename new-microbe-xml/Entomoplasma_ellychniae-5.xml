  <description>Entomoplasma ellychniae sp. nov. Entomoplasma ellychniae (el.lych’ni.ae. N.L. n. Ellychnia, a genus of firefly beetles; N.L. gen. n. ellychniae, of Ellychnia, from which the organism was first isolated). Cells are nonhelical, pleomorphic filaments, with some branching; small coccoid forms (varying in diameter from 200 to 300 nm) also occur. Cells lack true cell walls. Nonmotile. Colonies on solid medium containing 0.8% Noble agar usually have the appearance of fried eggs. Chemoorganotroph. Acid produced from glucose. Does not hydrolyze arginine or urea. Film and spot reaction negative.  Does not hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Cholesterol or serum is required for growth. Temperature range for growth, 18 to 32”C, with optimum growth at 30°C. Serologically distinct from previously described Mycoplasma species. Isolated from the hemolymph of the firefly beetle E. corrusca. Pathogenicity for insects has not been determined. The genome averages 585 megadaltons. The G+C content of the DNA is 27.5 +/- 1 mol%, as determined by the buoyant density method. The type strain is strain ELCN-1 (= ATCC 43707).</description>
