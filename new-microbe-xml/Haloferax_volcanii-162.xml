  <taxon_name>Haloferax_volcanii</taxon_name>
  <strain>DS2</strain>
  <reference>Bergey’s Manual pg 315-316</reference>
  <file>Cells extremely pleomorphic, frequently flat, disk shaped, or cup shaped even under optimal conditions.  Cells 1-2 x 2-3 µm.  Gram negative.  Flagella have not been demonstrated.  Movement is different from that of the polarly flagellated strains of halobacteria.  Oxidase- and catalase-positive.  Acid produced from sugars.  Amino acids not required.  The polar lipids are characterized by the presence of C20C20 derivatives of S-DGD-1 and the absence of PGS.  Resistant to penicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline.  Sensitive to anisomycin, bacitracin, novobiocin, and vibriostatic reagent (0/129). Best growth occurs in media containing 1.5-2.5 M NaCl.  5M NaCl is inhibitory.  Minimal Mg2+ concentration 0.02 M.  Tolerant to 1.5 M Mg2+.  Optimum growth temperature 45˚C.  Chemoorganotrophic.  Growth occurs on sugars as the sole source of carbon; acid is produced from glucose and other sugars.  Indole is produced.  H2S is produced from thiosulfate.  Nitrate is reduced to nitrite.  Found in the Dead Sea.  The mol% G+C of the DNA is 63.4 (Tm) and 66.5 (Bd), and 55.3 (Bd) minor component.  Gas vacuoles absent.</file>
