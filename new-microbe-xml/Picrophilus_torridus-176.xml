  <description>Obligately aerobic, heterotrophic, moderately thermophilic, hyperacidophilic, irregular cocci.  Grows at temperatures between 47 and 65°C and optimally at 60°C.  Grows at pH values between about 0 and 3.5 and optimally at pH 0.7.  Grows in the presence of 0.1 to 0.5% yeast extract and optimally in the presence of 0.2% yeast extract; a lag phase occurs in the presence of 0.5% yeast extract.  Unable to grow by fermentation or chemolithoautotrophically by formation of H2S from sulfur and hydrogen or by sulfur respiration.  Under optimal conditions, the generation time is 6 h.  Slow growth to a low density occurs on tryptone, and no growth occurs on many other carbon sources.  The diameter of the cells is about 1 µm.  Division occurs by constriction.  There is a regular filigree teragonal S layer, which probably has polysaccharide chains on the outside.  Large cavities, apparently not separated from the cytoplasm by a membrane, often are observed in sections.  The lattice constant of the S layer is 20 nm.  No pili or flagellae are observed.  The bis-phytanyl tetraetherlipids are dominated by a single phosphoglycolipid component.  The G+C content of the DNA is 36 mol%. Grows significantly faster than P.  oshimae.  No plasmid is present.</description>
