  <description>Coccoid bodies 1.5-2.0 µm in diameter, occurring mostly in irregular aggregates.  Gram positive.  Nonmotile.  Strictly anaerobic.  Energy metabolism via formation of methane from acetate, methanol, monomethylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, H2/CO2, and CO.  Not lysed by SDS.  The methyl group of methanol or acetate is reduced to CH4 without intermediate oxidation to CO2.  Carbohydrates, amino acids, fromate, ethanol, propionate, and butyrate are not fermented.  Ammonia or N2 serves as a nitrogen source, and sulfide serves as a sulfur source.  Growth on H2/CO2 or methanol is preferred.  Optimum growth is obtained at pH 7.0 and at 30-40˚C.  Habitat is freshwater and marine mud, rumes of ungulates, animal waste lagoons, and sludge from anaerobic seqage sludge digestors.  Capable of growth on 0-0.5 M NaCl.  Mol % G+C ranges from 39-44.</description>
