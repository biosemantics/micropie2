  <description>Cells are gram-negative irregular cocci, about 0.5-1.5 µm in diameter.  Cells are flagellate, with a single flagellum.  Cells form cytoplasmatic protrusions, in particular during the stationary growth phase.  They grow heterotrophically on yeast extract, peptone, tryptone, casamino acids, or cell-free extracts of Pyrococcus furiosus or Thermococcus celer, but only in the presence of both molecular hydrogen and elemental sulfur.  Hydrogen is obligately required as an electron donor.  H2S is formed from sulfur during growth.  Sulfur or thiosulfate act as electron acceptors.  The presence of CO2 stimulates growth.  Cells are hyperthermophiles growing between 68˚C and 102˚C with an optimum at 95˚C, between pH 4.5 and 7.0 with the optimum at 6, and between 0.5% and 6% NaCl.  The doubling time is 3.1 h.  The G+C content of DNA is 65 mol%.  Isolated from a shallow submarine hydrothermal system at Paleohori Bay in Milose, Greece.  Type species Stetteria hydrogenophila DSM 11227.  No growth was observed in the presence of ribose, xylose, glucose, saccharose, lactose, xylane, starch, pyruvate, acetate or citrate as the sole carbon source.  No growth on single amino acids or pairwise combinations of amino acids.  Amino acids tested were: alanine, arginine, aspartate, cystine, glycine, methionine, histidine, hydroxy-proline, lysine, proline, and valine.  No growth on formate as an electron donor.  No growth on nitrate, malate, fumarate, Fe(III), sulfite, cysteine, or thiosulfate as electron acceptors.</description>
