  <description>Isolated from surface sediments at the La Brea Tar Pits.  The cells were coccoid with a diameter of 0.4-2.0 µm.  They were irregular in shape under some growth conditions, such as higher salt or with added acetate.  Motility was not observed and flagella were not observed.  Growth was observed on H2/CO2 or formate, but not with acetate, propionate, methanol, trimethylamine, or ethanol.  Growth was observed in a narrow window of pH, from 6.5 to 7.5, with pH 7.0 as the optimal value.  Growth was observed between 25 and 40°C, with an optimum at 37°C.  Can tolerate a wide range of salt concentration, from 0 to 30 g/L NaCl.  Acetate was stimulatory at lower salt concentrations.  Trypticase peptone, yeast extract, or cysteine was required for growth.</description>
