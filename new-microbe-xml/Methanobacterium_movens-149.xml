  <description>Cells are rods (0.4–0.5 µm wide x 2–5 µm long), occurring singly or in pairs and motile by one or two polar flagella.  Uses only H2/CO2 for methane production.  Formate, acetate, methanol, ethanol, trimethylamine, isobutanol and 2-propanol are not used.  Yeast extract is indispensable for growth.  Grows optimally at 35–38 ˚C and pH 7.2–7.5.  The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 39.1 mol% (Tm) and 39.5 mol% (HPLC).  The type strain TS-2T (=AS 1.5093T=JCM 15415T), was isolated from the sediment of Tuosu lake, China.</description>
