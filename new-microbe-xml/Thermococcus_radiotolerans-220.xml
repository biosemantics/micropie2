  <description>Cells are cocci (diameter, 0.5 to 1.1 µm) that are motile due to the presence of polar flagella.  Cell division occurs by constriction.  It is an obligate anaerobe and grows optimally in the presence of 20 g of NaCl per liter at a pH around 6.0.  Growth occurs from 55 to 95 ˚C, with an optimum temperature at around 88 ˚C.  It is an obligate chemorganotroph and grows preferentially on proteolytic products such as yeast extract , beef extract, tryptone, and peptone.  Sulfur is necessary for growth.  Type strain EJ2T (DSM 15228T = JCM 11826T) was isolated from an active chimney-wall fragment recovered from a hydrothermal site in the Guaymas Basin.  The isolation was performed after gamma-exposure of 30 kGy of the enrichment culture. Able to resist doses of 3 kGy without loss of cultivability.  No growth occurred at pH 3.0 to 9.0.  No growth was detected at NaCl concentrations of 0 and 40 g per liter.  No growth was detected in the presence of thiosulfate, sulfate, and sulfite.  Unable to grow on amino acids.  No growth on casamino acids, acetate, succinate, propionate, pyruvate, gelatin, sucrose, cellobiose, lactose, maltose, glycogen, xylose, and starch.  Resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, penicillin, kanamycin, vancomycin, and streptomycin.  Sensitive to rifampicin.  The G+C content was 54.5 mol% (Tm).</description>
