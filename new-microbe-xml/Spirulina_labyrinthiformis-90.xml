  <description>tightly coiled trichomes, halotolerant, Cyanobacteria with tightly coiled trichomes are frequently found in thermal freshwater environments as well as in brackish, marine and hypersaline waters, Under favourable conditions they can form dense benthic populations and make major contributions to primary productivity., they are traditionally considered cosmopolitan micro-organisms with remarkable capabilities to acclimatize to broad ranges of environmental conditions, euryhaline cyanobacteria, from hypersaline waters, The only freshwater strain available (CCC Snake-P. Y-85) tolerated 1±6% total salts, but died at marine salinity (3±2%)., Strain CCC Snake P. Y-85 was isolated from a 50 °C site in a sulfidic freshwater hot spring, it showed growth between 35 and 45 °C and did not grow at 50 °C. Natural populations of this organism showed an upper temperature limit of 51 °C and maximum photosynthesis rates at 45 °C., contained phycocyanin, The carotenoid composition in the freshwater strain CCC Snake P. Y-85 and in the marine strains PCC 6313 and MPI S1 was found to be very similar.</description>
