  <description>Mycoplasma testudineum (tes.tu.din'e.um. L. neut. adj. testudineum of or belonging to a tortoise). Cells predominantly coccoid in shape, varying from 200 to 800 nm in diameter. Cells devoid of cell wall and surrounded only by cytoplasmic membrane. Non-helical and non-motile. Cells filterable through 200 nm membranes. Colonies on solid medium with 0.8% agar exhibit typical fried-egg forms. Chemoorganotrophic. Acid produced from glucose. Does not hydrolyse arginine or urea. Serum or sterol required for sustained growth. Growth temperature range 22â€“30C, optimum 30C. Serologically distinct from all other recognized Mycoplasma species. First isolated from the upper respiratory tract of a free-ranging desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) in the Mojave Desert. Pathogenic for gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus). The type strain is BH29 (=ATCC 700618 =MCCM 03231). Its 16S rRNA gene sequence is unique (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession no. AY366210).</description>
