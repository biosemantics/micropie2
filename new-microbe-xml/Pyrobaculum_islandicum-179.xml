  <description>Cells are Gram-negative rods with almost rectangular ends, occurring singly and in V-, X- and raft-shaped aggregates.  Terminal spheres ("golf-clubs") appear during the exponential growth phase.  No septa formation observed.  Cells are about 0.5 µm in width.  Cells are usually about 2.5 µm long and exhibit bipolar polytrichous flagellation, each flagellum up to 15 µm long and about 13 nm in width.  V-shaped aggregates of 2 cells with different angles are formed.  Packed cells exhibit a green colour.  Growth at 74˚C and in the presence of 0.8% (w/v) NaC1. Strictly anaerobic.  Optimal doubling time (in closed culture vessels) about 260 min at 100˚C.  Facultatively organotrophic.  During organotrophic growth, S˚, thiosulfate, sulfite, L-cystine and oxidized glutathione serve as electron acceptors.  Isolates were obtained from boiling solfataric and geothermal waters in Iceland.  The type strain is Pyrobaculum islandicum, GEO3, DSM 4184, Gottingen, FRG.  Cells are insensitive against penicillin G, streptomycin, phosphomycin, vancomycin, and chloramphenicol and sensitive against rifampicin (most likely unspecific inhibition).  44-48 mol% G+C.  Lithoautotrophic growth on H2, CO2 and elemental sulfur by H2/S-autotrophy. Isopranyl ether lipids in the cell membrane.  Sulfur could not be replaced by sulfate, tetrathionate, or dimethyl sulfone.  Unable to use DL-lanthionine, fumarate, tetrathionate, dimethyl sulfone or sulfate as an electron acceptor.</description>
