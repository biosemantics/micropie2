  <description>Spiroplasma lampyridicola sp. nov. Spiroplasma lampri'dicola (lam.py.ri.di'co.la. M .L. n. Lampyridae, the firefly beetle family; L. v. colo, to inhabit; M.L. adj. lampyridicola, an inhabitant of members of the Lampyridae). Cells are filamentous, helical, and about 150 nm in diameter and lack a cell wall. Colonies on solid medium containing 3.0% Noble agar are small and granular with dense centers but do not have a true fried-egg appearance. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose, trehalose, and fructose. Does not hydrolyze arginine or urea. Cholesterol or serum is required for growth. The temperature range for growth is 15 to 37°C, and the optimum temperature is 30 to 32°C. Serologically unrelated to other spiroplasma species and groups. The type strain was isolated from the gut fluids of a firefly beetle (P. pennsylvanicus). Related strains have been isolated from other Photuris species and from A. fulvus pallens and C. nippalpus mosquitoes.  The pathogenicity for insect hosts has not been determined. The G+C content of the DNA is 26 +/- 1 mol%. The genome size is 1,375 kbp. The type strain is PUP-1 (= ATCC 43206).</description>
