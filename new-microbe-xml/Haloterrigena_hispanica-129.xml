  <description>Cells are Gram-negative, coccoid (1.5–2.0 µm in diameter) and become oval in stationary cultures.  Colonies on complex agar medium with 3.4 M NaCl are light red, elevated and circular.  Growth occurs at NaCl concentrations of 2.2–4.0 M, at Mg2+ concentrations of 0–0.4 M, at pH values in the range 6.5–8.5 and at temperatures of 37–60 ˚C.  The optimal NaCl concentration, Mg2+ concentration, pH and temperature for growth are 3.4 M, 0.2 M, pH 7.0 and 50 ˚C, respectively.  Chemo-organotrophic and aerobic.  Oxidase- and catalase-positive.  Indole formation is positive.  Nitrate reduction is observed but nitrite reduction is not.  Gelatin, starch, casein, and Tweens 20, 40 and 60 are not hydrolysed.  The following substrates are utilized for growth: glycerol, sodium acetate, sodium propionate and sodium citrate.  Glucose, mannose, rhamnose, fructose, sucrose, galactose, trehalose, ribose, xylose, cellobiose and arabinose are not utilized for growth.  Sensitive to (µg per disc) fusidic acid (10), bacitracin (10) and novobiocin (30).  Resistant to the following antibiotics (µg per disc): streptomycin (25), tetracycline (50), nystatin (100), vancomycin (30), kanamycin (30), lincomycin (10), neomycin (30), erythromycin (30), ampicillin (25), chloramphenicol (50) and penicillin (10 U).  Major polar lipids are C20C20 and C20C25 derivatives of PG, PGP-Me and S-DGD.  The DNA G+C content is 62.0 mol% (Tm).  The type strain, FP1T (=DSM 18328T=ATCC BAA-1310T), was isolated from Fuente de Piedra salt lake, southern Spain.</description>
