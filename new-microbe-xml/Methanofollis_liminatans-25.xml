  <description>Irregularly coccoid or ring-shaped cells, 1.25-2.0 µm in diameter, with a proteinaceous, SDS-sensitive S-layer.  Cells stain Gram-negative.  Some strains may be motile.  Obligately anaerobic, no microaerophilic or aerobic growth.  Cells are mesophilic (range 15˚C to 45˚C) with an optimum at 40 ˚C.  Substrates for growth and methane production are H2/CO2, formate, 2-propanol/CO2, 2-butanol/CO2 and cyclopentanol/CO2.  Secondary and cyclic alcohols are oxidized to the respective ketones.  Methanol, methylamines, ethanol and acetate are not utilized as catabolic substrates.  Cells of GKZPZT contain a secondary alcohol dehydrogenase dependent on F420 and devoid of Zn.  Lipid composition as that described for the genus.  The G+C content of DNA of the type strain is 60 mol % (Tm).  The type strain is GKZPZT (= DSM 4140T), isolated from an industrial wastewater bioreactor (Biohochreaktor, Hoechst, Kelsterbach, Frankfurt, Germany).  Strain BMl (= DSM 10196) is a reference strain, isolated from a methane-producing fluidized bed reactor operated with synthetic wastewater containing butyrate and present in a full-scale UASB reactor treating sugar refinery wastewater anaerobically in Bruhl, Germany.</description>
