  <description>Spiroplasma ixodetis. Spiroplasma ixodetis (ix.o.de’tis M.L. gen. n. ixodetis, of Ixodes, the genus name of I. pacificus ticks, from which the organism was first isolated). Cells consist of various mixtures of coccoid forms (diameter, 300 to 500 nm), straight and branched filamentous cells, and helical organisms. Cells lack a cell wall. Motile. Colonies on solid medium containing 2.25% Noble agar usually have the appearance of fried eggs. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Does not hydrolyze arginine or urea. Agar colonies hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes but not erythrocytes of other mammalian species. Cholesterol or serum is required for growth. The temperature range for growth is 23 to 32°C; optimum growth occurs at 30°C. Serologically distinct from previously described Spiroplasma species. Isolated from macerated tissue suspensions prepared from pooled adult I. pacificus ticks (Ixodidae) collected in Oregon.  Pathogenicity for plants or insects has not been determined. Organisms exhibit growth and cytadherence to various tick and insect cells in culture, without obvious cytopathogenic effects. The average genome size is 2,220 kbp. The average G+C content of the DNA is 25.0 mol%, as determined by buoyant density, melting temperature, and HPLC techniques. The type strain is Y32 (= ATCC 33835).</description>
