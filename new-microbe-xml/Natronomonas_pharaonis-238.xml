  <file>Cells are short rods 0.8 x 1-3 µm in liquid culture.  Gram negative.  Motile by a tuft of polar flagella.  Chemoorganotrophic and strictly aerobic.  Halophilic and alkaliphilic.  Growth occurs between pH 7 and 10 and between 25-50˚C.  Sugars are not utilized.  Casamino acids and glutamate are used as nitrogen sources.  Gelatin is liquefied by most strains.  Sulfide is formed from thiosulfate.  Indole is formed from tryptophan.  Starch and casein not hydrolyzed.  Nitrate is reduced to nitrite.  Polar lipids are glycerol-diether analogs of phosphatidyl glycerol (PG), methyl ester of phosphatidyl glycerol phosphate (PGP-Me), phosphatidic acid (PA), and an unknown phospholipid PL1.  Both diphytanyl moieties C20C20 and phytanyl-sesterterpanyl moieties C20C25 detected. Colonies are 1-2 mm in diameter after 5-7 d at 37˚C, translucent, and red.  Pleomorphic motile rods, originally isolated from the alkaline brines of eutrophic desert lakes of Wadi Natrun, Egypt.  Optimum temperature for growth 45˚C.  A large plasmid 144 kb is present.  The mol % D+C of the DNA is 64.3 (Tm) and 61.2 (Bd).</file>
