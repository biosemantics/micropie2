  <description>filamentous, nondiazotrophic cyanobacterium. thrives under extreme salt and pH conditions. In its natural environment, Arthrospira sp. filaments grow to high cell densities. They are known to maintain a sodium gradient that is used to import carbonate via an obligate sodium carbonate symporter. As expected, they also have a membrane-bound sodium extrusion pump that is dependent on the presence of ATP.</description>
