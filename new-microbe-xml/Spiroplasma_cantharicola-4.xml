Gr. kuntharos, scarab beetle; the L.V. colo, to inhabit; M.L. n. cantharicola, an inhabitant of a family of beetles). Cells filamentous, helical, motile, lacking true cell walls. Colonies on solid medium with 0.8% Noble agar diffuse, without fried egg morphology. Chemoorganotroph. Acid produced from glucose. Does not hydrolyze arginine or urea. Film and spot reaction positive. Does not hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Sterol requirement met by cholesterol or serum. Temperature range 10 to 37C, optimum 32C, with a doubling time of 2.6 h. Serologically distinct from other established Spiroplasma species. Isolated from gut of an adult cantharid beetle C. carolinus. Pathogenicity for insects not determined. G+C content of DNA 26 +/- 1 mol%, as determined by buoyant-density, melting-point, and high-performance liquid chromatography techniques. The type strain is CC-1 (= ATCC 43207).</description>
