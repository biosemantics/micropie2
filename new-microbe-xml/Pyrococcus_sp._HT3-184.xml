  <description>Cocci with a diameter of 0.8–2 µm occurring singly.  The cells were highly motile.  The optimum growth temperature was around 80–85 ˚C.  Grew between pH 6-9, optimally at pH 7.5.  The isolate grew in media containing 1–3.5% NaCl with an optimum between 1.5 and 2.0%.  Able to use the following organic substrates: glucose, galactose, sorbitol, mannose, fructose, rhamnose, lactose, maltose, trehalose, dextrine, soluble starch, glycogen, pullulan, cellobiose, pectin, galacturonic acid, lactate, sucrose, beef extract, casein hydrolysate, brain heart infusion, casamino acids, pyruvate, peptone, tryptone, and amino acids.  Unable to use the following organic substrates: xylose, arabinose, mannitol, melibiose, raffinose, xylan, citrate, and acetate.  NH4Cl, peptone, tryptone, yeast extract, alanine, aspartic acid, isoleucine, methionine, and arginine could serve as nitrogen sources.   Resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin, cephalosphorin, gentamycin, rifampicin, and oxacillin.  Strict anaerobe.  The isolate did not grow when oxygen or air was present in the culture medium.  No growth observed in sulfur-free medium.  H2 inhibitory to growth and sulfur reduction appeared to serve as a hydrogen sink.  No fatty acids in significant quantities.  Typical Archaeal lipids phytanylglycerol diethers and dibiphytanyl tetraethers confirmed by thin layer chromatography.  Isolated from a continental hot spring in Northeast Algeria, at 13 m depth.  The G+C content was 43 mol%.  Able to grow in the presence of FeSO4, (NH4)2SO4, NaSO3, NaNO2, and Mn(II).</description>
