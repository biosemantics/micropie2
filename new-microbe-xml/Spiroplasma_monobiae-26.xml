  <description>Spiroplasma monobiae sp. nov. Spiroplasma monobiae (mon.o'bi.ae. M.L. n. Monobia, a genus of vespid wasps; M.L. gen. n. monobiae, of the genus Monobia, from which the organism was isolated). Cells are helical, motile filaments. Cells lack true cell walls. Colonies on solid medium containing 2.25% Noble agar are diffuse, never with a fried-egg appearance. Chemoorganotroph. Acid produced from glucose. Does not hydrolyze arginine or urea. Film and spot reaction negative. Does not hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Cholesterol or serum required for growth. Temperature range for growth, 10 to 37°C; optimum growth occurs at 32°C with a doubling time of 1.9 h. Serologically distinct from other established Spiroplasma species. Isolated from the hemolymph of an adult vespid wasp (M. quadridens). Pathogenicity for insects not determined. The G+C content of the DNA is 28 +/- 1 mol%. The genome size is 940 kbp (627 MDa). The type strain is MQ-1 (= ATCC 33825).</description>
