  <description>Cells are irregularly coccoid, 1.0-2.0 µm in diameter, with a proteinaceous cell wall, and flagellated.  Strictly anaerobic.  Cells grow on H2/CO2, formate, 2-propanol/CO2, 2-butanol/CO2 and cyclopentanol/ CO2 as substrates for methanogenesis.  Acetate, ethanol, methanol and methylamines are not utilized.  The optimum temperature and pH for growth are 25-30°C and 6.7-7.2.  Cells contain archaeol and caldarchaeol as core lipids, aminopentanetetrol and glycerol as phospholipid polar head groups and galactose as glycolipid sugar, but glucose is absent.  The type strain is MG62T (=JCM 10825T=DSM 13459T), which was isolated from a paddy field soil in Chikugo, Fukuoka, Japan.</description>
