  <file>Methanocorpusculum.parvum.pdf</file>
  <description>Small, irregular coccoid cells, usually occurring singly or in pairs, &lt; 1 µm in diameter.  Weakly motile by a single flagellum.  Gram negative.  Cell envelope with a hexagonal subunit structure.  Chemoorganotrophic and strictly anaerobic.  Optimum temperature near 37˚C Optimum pH around 7.  No growth dependence on NaCl (&gt; 0 - 47 g/l).  Methane is produced from H2/CO2, formate and 2- propanol/CO2.  No growth and methane production on acetate, methylamines and methanol, either in the presence or absence of H2.  Furthermore, no growth on pyruvate, lactate, fumarate, propionate, butyrate, ethanol, l-butanol, 2- pentanol, formaldehyde, L-alanine, L-lysine and e-leucine, either in the presence or absence of 1 µM tungstate.  Acetate, yeast extract and tungsten are required for growth.  Optimal concentration of tungstate about 1 µM for growth on H2/CO2.  Clarified rumen fluid stimulates growth.  The mol% G+C is 48.5 (Tm).  The type species is Methanocorpusculum parvum gen. nov., spec. nov. and the type strain is isolate XII (DSM 3823).  The habitat is sewage sludge and strain XII was isolated from an anaerobic sour whey digester inoculated with sewage sludge.</description>
