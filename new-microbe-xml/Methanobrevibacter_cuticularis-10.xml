  <description>Straight short rods with slightly tapered ends, 0.4 by 1.2 µm in size, occurring singly, in pairs, or in short chains.  Nonmotile.  Gram positive-like by staining and cell wall ultrastructure.  No endospores formed.  Strict anaerobe.  Catalase positive, oxidase negative.  Metabolizes H2 plus CO2 and formate (the latter very poorly), yielding CH4 as the sole product.  Methanol, methanol plus H2, CO, acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, trimethylamine, dimethylamine, theobromine, theophylline, trimethoxybenzoate, lactate, pyruvate, and glucose are not metabolized.  pH optimum 7.7 (range 6.5 to 8.5); temperature optimum 37˚C (range 10 to 37˚C).  Chemolithotrophic growth occurs very slowly.  Yeast extract, a source of amino acids (e.g., Casamino Acids), and ca. 2% clarified rumen fluid are markedly stimulatory to growth.  Source: Hindgut contents of the termite Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) (Rhinotermitidae).   Type strain: RFM-1.</description>
