  <description>Two mycoplasmas recovered from human urogenital tracts were similar in their biochemical and serological properties. These organisms possessed a unique terminal structure that appeared to be associated with attachment to tissue cells and erythrocytes. The organisms fermented glucose but did not hydrolyze urea or arginine. Growth occurred at 30 to 37Â°C. Cholesterol was required for growth. Unlike most other mycoplasmas, both strains were susceptible to thallium acetate. These two organisms were serologically distinct from other Mycoplasma species and from a group of unclassified serotypes of mycoplasmas. On the basis of these findings and other morphological, biological, and serological properties of the microorganisms, we propose that mycoplasmas with these characteristics belong to a new species, Mycoplasma genitalium. Strain G-37 (= ATCC 33530) is the type strain.</description>
