  <description>Cells are Gram-negative and rod-shaped, 0.4-0.8 lm by 3-7 µm.  Motile.  Cells lyse in diluted medium containing less than 1.5 M NaCl or in distilled water.  Colonies are bright red, circular, 1.0-2.0 mm in diameter and convex.  Requires 2.5 M saturated NaCl for growth, optimum 3.5 M.  pH range for growth 8.0-10.5, optimum 8.5.  Temperature range for growth 26-44 °C, optimum 36-41 °C.  Chemo-organotrophic.  Grows anaerobically in the presence of nitrate, DMSO or TMAO or aerobically.  Utilizes alanine, ornithine and pyruvate.  Reduces nitrate to nitrite.  Forms sulfide from sulfur and thiosulfate.  No indole formation.  Hydrolyses starch, gelatin and Tween 80.  Possesses C20C20 and C20C25 diether core lipids.  No glycolipids.  Possesses phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylglycerophosphate methyl ester (PGP-Me) and a minor phospholipid, PL1.  Sensitive to anisomycin, aphidicolin, bacitracin, erythromycin, novobiocin and rifampicin.  Insensitive to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, neomycin and penicillin G.  The type strain is C231T (=AS 1.1980T =JCM 10879T).  Did not grow anaerobically with arginine.  Did not reduce nitrite.  Did not hydrolyze casein. No or negligible growth enhancement occurred with arabinose, fumarate, galactose, glutamate, glycerol, glycine, lactose, lysine, malate, maltose, mannose, propionate, raffinose, rhamnose, ribose, sorbitol, starch, succinate, sucrose and xylose.  No gas vacuoles.</description>
