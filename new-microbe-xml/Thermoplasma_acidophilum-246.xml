  <file>Pleomorphic, varying in shape from spherical to filamentous structures.  Cells 0.1-0.5 µm.  Cells lack a true cell wall and are surrounded by a single triple layer membrane.  Membrane contains ether lipids based on 40 carbon, isopranoid branched diglycerol tetraethers.  Lipids lack fatty acid ester residues.  The lipids are ether-linked C40 biphytanyl diglycerol tetraethers along with small amounts of C20 phytanyl glycerol diethers.  Gram negative.  Facultatively aerobic.  Anaerobic growth is enhanced by elemental sulfur, which is reduced to H2S via respiration.  Obligate thermoacidophile.  Growth occurs at 45-63˚C and pH 0.5-4.  Optimal growth occurs at 59˚C and pH 2.0.  Cells undergo lysis near neutrality.  Obligately heterotrophic with growth on extracts of yeast, meat, and bacteria or archaea cells.  Occur free-living in self-heated coal refuse piles and acidic solfatara fields.  The mol % G+C of the DNA is 46.  Cells are generally motile, with a single polar flagellum.  Sucrose, glucose, galactose, mannose, and fructose stimulate growth.  Resistant to vancomycin, ampicillin, ristocetin, novobiocin, rifampicin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol.</file>
