  <description>Cells are rod-shaped (0.8–1.0 µm wide by 3–5 µm long), occurring singly or in pairs; however, they are arranged as a chain within a common sheath at high cell density when grown in high concentrations of acetate (&gt;100 mM).  Gram-variable.  Non-motile.  Cells are resistant to lysis by 1% SDS (w/v) and hypotonic solution, whereas the sheath of the long chain is partly destroyed by proteinase K (50 mg per mL).  Methanogenic.  Acetate is the exclusive tested substrate for growth and methanogenesis.  No growth on or methane production from H2/CO2, formate, methanol, ethanol, trimethylamine, isobutanol or isopropanol.  Formate is not cleaved to hydrogen and carbon dioxide.  Yeast extract or peptone are required for growth, but not vitamins.  The temperature range for growth is 25–45 ˚C, with optimal growth at 34–37 ˚C.  The pH range for growth is 6.5–9.0 and the optimum pH is 7.2–7.6.  The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 55.7 mol% (Tm).  The type strain, 8AcT (=JCM 13211T=CGMCC 1.5026T), was isolated from granules from a UASB anaerobic digester treating beer-manufacture wastewater.</description>
