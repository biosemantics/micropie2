  <description>Non-heterocytous, filamentous strain, characterized by having isopolar filaments which taper at the apices and terminate in a hair. Attaches to substrate with colorless mucilaginous pad at the base of mature filaments. Brown to purple in color, with brown tending to be younger in age. Swollen at base and tapered at ends of filaments. Basal cells contain granulated content and parietal thylakoids, with a large central granule 0.75-1.5 µm long. Thickness of cells 3.5 µm. Sheath firm, rough, colorless to blackish-purple, 0.5-1 µm thick. Color of sheath darkens with age. Apices not enclosed in sheath, pale brownish pink color. Isolated from warm desert sandstone seep wells in freshwater in  August 2006 along Lower Calf Creek Falls, UT, USA . Growth optimum at 15ºC daylight, 10ºC dark. Formation of star-like colonies due to fragmentation at maturity, with basal cells attached collectively at mucilaginous pad. Colony on agar is brown to black. Shares characteristics with five different genera, but is outside of the similarity range for the species to belong to another genus. Similarity of 91.1% in 16S sequence structure with genus Leptolyngbya,  but did not have similar16S-23S ITS secondary structures. Often appears in an epilithic made with many other taxa, and likely requires flowing water to develop its characteristic hetereopolar, tapering morpholog. Fairly common in unpolluted streams with rocky benthose, forming tufts of filamentous colonies. Holotype: BRY37705. Reference strain: Tapinothrix GSE-PSE06-07G.
