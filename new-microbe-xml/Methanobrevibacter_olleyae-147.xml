  <description>Cells occur singly or in pairs and are coccobacilli (0.3–1.0 µm) with rounded ends.  Cells stain Gram-positive, although some variability is evident.  Non-motile and resistant to lysis by 10% SDS.  Grows and produces methane from H2/CO2 (80:20) and from formate plus CO2 (reference strains OCP and AK-87 cannot utilize formate plus CO2).  Acetate, methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, 2- butanol, methylamine and trimethylamine are not utilized as substrates.  Requires acetate for growth and does not require co-enzyme M or fatty acids.  Strain OCP requires yeast extract and peptone in addition to acetate, and strain AK-87 requires co-enzyme M and fatty acids in addition to these.  Bile-sensitive.  Mesophilic.  No growth in BRN medium below 28 ˚C or above 42 ˚C, although the temperature range for strain AK-87 is restricted to 36–43 ˚C.  The optimum temperature range for growth is 28–42 ˚C.  pH range for growth is 6.0–10.0; optimum pH is 7.5.  The maximum salt tolerance for growth is 2.6 %, although growth is inhibited in strain AK-87 at this concentration.  The DNA G+C content is 27–29 mol% (Tm).  The type strain, KM1H5-1PT (=DSM 16632T=OCM 841T), was isolated from enrichments of sheep rumen contents.  Reference strains OCP and AK-87 were isolated from enrichments of bovine rumen contents.</description>
