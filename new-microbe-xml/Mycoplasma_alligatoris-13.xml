  <description>Mycoplasma alligatoris (all.ig.a.tor«is. L. gen. n. alligatoris from an alligator). Cells lack a true cell wall and are surrounded only by cytoplasmic membrane. Non-helical and non-motile. Cells filterable through 200 nm membranes. Colonies on solid medium with 0.8% agar exhibit typical fried egg morphology at low magnification. Chemoorganotroph. Acid produced from glucose. Does not hydrolyse arginine nor urea. Serum or sterol required for sustained growth. Temperature range 22 to 34°C, with optimum at 30 to 34°C. Serologically distinct from all other established Mycoplasma species. Genome size 1040-1060 kbp. Isolated from multiple organs, blood, synovial fluid and cerebrospinal fluid of diseased American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) in Florida. The organism is a lethal pathogen of alligators. The 16S rRNA gene nucleotide sequence is unique. The type strain is A21JP2 (ATCC 700619T).</description>
