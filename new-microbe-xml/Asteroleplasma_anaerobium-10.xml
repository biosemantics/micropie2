  <description>Proposal for Asteroleplasma anaerobium gen. nov., sp. nov. Among the anaerobic mycoplasmas, the group represented by strains 161, 162, and 163 differs from members of the genus Anaeroplasma in not requiring sterol for growth. The significance of this group and the need for clarification of their taxonomic status within the Mollicutes is further emphasized by the recent finding that sterol non-requiring organisms compose a large proportion of the anaerobic mollicute population of the rumen in cattle and sheep. Strains 161, 162, and 163 form a homogeneous and distinct serological group, tentatively referred to as serovar 4. The distinctiveness of the group was further confirmed and strengthened by the study of Stephens et al. (24) who obtained less than 5% DNA-DNA homology between these strains and all other anaerobic mycoplasmas tested, as opposed to about 80% homology among the three strains themselves.  Furthermore, there was no significant hybridization between a [3H] DNA probe prepared from strain 161 and unlabeled DNA from each of the nine established Acholeplasma species. Moreover, determination of the G + C ratio was considerably higher for strains 161 and 162 (40.2 and 40.3%, respectively) than for A. abactoclasticum (6-l), A. bactoclasticum (JR), A. varium (A-2), and A. intermedium (7LA), viz. 40.2 and 40.3% versus 29.3, 33.7, 33.4, and 32.5%, respectively. The genome size of strain 161 was about 1,000 megadaltons; this is similar to the genome size of other anaerobic mycoplasmas. Collectively, the nutritional, antigenic, and genomic characteristics of strains 161, 162, and 163 clearly indicate their unique taxonomic status as compared with anaerobic mycoplasmas of the genus Anaeroplasma and with sterol non-requiring facultatively anaerobic mollicutes of the family Acholeplasmataceae.  In accordance with the opinion previously expressed by Stephens et al. (24), these organisms should belong to a new genus, for which we propose the name Asteroleplasma (A.ste.ro1.e.plas’ma. Gr. pref. a not; sterol derived from Gr. adj. stereos solid, plus Lat. n. oleum oil, ending of cholesterol, ergosterol, etc., and used as a separate word to denote a class of solid monohydroxy alcohols; e combining vowel; Gr. neut. n. plasma something formed or molded, a form; M.L. neut. n. Asteroleplasma name intended to indicate that sterol is not required for growth). The three related strains examined most thoroughly, strains 161, 162, and 163, are placed in a single species, Asteroleplasma anaerobium (an.ae .ro’bi.um. Gr. pref. an not; Gr. n. aer air; Gr. n. bios life; M.L. adj. anaerobius not living in air). Strain 161 (ATCC 27880) is designated as the type strain of the species.</description>
