  <description>Filaments at first in small, loose fascicles, when mature in large dense fascicles, not incrusted with calcium carbonate, without an obvious base of coccoid cyanobacteria, 10–80 μm long. Sheath colorless when young, becoming distinctly yellowish with age, thin to wide, not uncommonly extending past tip of trichome. Trichomes distinctly constricted at the cross–walls, tapering, 2.3 – 3.5 (4) μm wide, tapering to a hair, which is 1 μm wide. Cells barrel–shaped, isodiametric or slightly longer or shorter than wide in midregion,with thin cross–walls, nongranular. Basal cells often longer than wide, 4 – 7 μm long, and can be thinner than midregion cells. Apical cells in hair longer than wide. Holotype here designated: ANSP sample GS162709, collected 26 July 2006. Type locality: West Piney Creek, at Bado, Texas County, Missouri. It is epilithic in circumneutral to slightly alkaline running waters. Possible more species exist in North America, plasticity within populations observed.</description>
