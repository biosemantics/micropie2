  <description>Spiroplasma diminutum sp. nov. Spiroplasma diminutum (di.min.u'tum. L. verb deminuere, to make pieces, make smaller; L. neut. partic. perf. diminutum, made smaller, reflecting a smaller size). Cells are short (1- to 2-um) helical filaments (diameter 100 to 200 nm) that appear to be rapidly moving irregularly spheroidal bodies when logarithmic phase broth cultures are examined under dark-field illumination. Colonies on solid medium containing 1.6% Noble agar have dense centers, granular perimeters, and nondistinct edges with satellite colonies. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Does not hydrolyze arginine or urea. Film and spot reaction positive. Does not hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Cholesterol or serum is required for growth. The temperature range for growth is 10 to 37°C; the optimum temperature is 30°C. Grows well in SP-4, MIA, or M1D medium. Serologically distinct from previously described Spiroplasma species. Isolated from a frozen triturate of female C. annulus mosquitoes.  Pathogenicity for insects has not been determined. The G+C content of the DNA is 26 +/- 1 mol%. The genome size is 1,080 kbp. The type strain is strain CUAS-1 (= ATCC 49235).</description>
