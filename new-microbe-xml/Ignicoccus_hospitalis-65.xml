  <description>Slightly irregular cocci, about 1–6 µm in diameter, with extracellular flagella-like appendages which insert at one cell pole.  Gram-negative.  Occurring singly and in pairs.  No evidence for a regular arrayed surface protein.  Grows at 73–98 ˚C, pH 4.5–7.0 and 0.5–5.5% NaCl (optima: 90 ˚C, pH 5.5, 1.4% NaCl).  Strictly anaerobic.  Chemolithoautotrophic growth in the presence of H2 and CO2 with sulfur as electron acceptor.  No chemo-organotrophic growth on meat extract, yeast extract, peptone, Casamino acids, gelatin, starch, formate, acetate or glucose.  Sulfate, sulfite, sulfide, thiosulfate, tetrathionate, nitrate and oxygen are not used as electron acceptors.  H2S is formed during growth.  Growth is stimulated by addition of 0.1% (w/v) meat extract or 0.02% (w/v) yeast extract.  The G+C content of genomic DNA of the type strain is 56 mol%.  The cell envelope consists of a cytoplasmic membrane, a periplasm of variable width and an outer membrane.  The main core lipids are archaeol and caldarchaeol.  Caldarchaeol does not appear in the purified outer membrane.  The predominant polar headgroups consist of one or more sugar residues (mainly mannose and small amounts of glucose) attached either directly to the core lipid or via a phosphate group.  Host organism for ‘N. equitans’.  The type strain is isolate KIN4/IT (=DSM 18386T=JCM 14125T), isolated from the Kolbeinsey Ridge, to the north of Iceland.</description>
