  <description>Cells are irregular cocci, 0.7-1-0 µm in diameter, motile with a bundle of flagella.  The cell envelope consists of one layer of subunits.  The major protein of the cell wall has an Mr of 56000.  Obligate anaerobe.  Grows at temperatures between 70 and 95 ˚C, optimally at 80-88 ˚C, and at pH 6.0-8.0 with an optimum at pH 6.5.  Grows on peptone, yeast extract, and starch.  Does not utilize glucose, maltose, Casamino acids, volatile fatty acids, acetate, propionate, methanol, ethanol, pyruvate, lactate or molecular hydrogen.  In closed vessels, growth is dependent on the presence of elemental sulfur which is reduced to H2S.  Growth products on peptone are CO2, H2S, acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate.  G + C content of DNA is 53.3 mol%.  Source of isolate: bottom deposits of the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand.  The type strain is strain P-4 (= DSM 10394T). Requires NaCl for growth.  Grows between 1.0-6.0% NaCl, optimal 2-3.5%. Unable to grow autotrophically on H2/CO2. Elemental sulfur could not be substituted by thiosulfate, sulfite, sulfate, cystine, fumarate or nitrate.</description>
