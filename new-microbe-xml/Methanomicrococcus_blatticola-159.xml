  <description>Cells form subsurface, lens-shaped, yellowish to brown colonies with a maximal diameter of ca.  0.3 µm in solid medium containing 1% agar or agarose.  Methanol, trimethylamine, dimethylamine and monomethylamine are reduced to methane with molecular hydrogen.  Formate, acetate, methanol alone, ethanol, pyruvate, lactate, malate, succinate and glucose are not utilized as methanogenic substrates.  Growth occurs between approximately 20 and 40 °C, with an optimum at 39 °C (doubling time 3.1 h); no growth is observed at 15 or 45 °C.  Optimal pH is 7.2-7.7 (range, 6.8-8.2).  NaCl optimum is &lt;100 mM (range, 0-300 mM).  Growth is dependent on HS-CoM and vitamins.  The type strain, Methanomicrococcus blatticola PAT, was isolated from the hindgut of the cockroach Periplaneta americana  Amsterdam (Blattidae).  The type strain has been deposited in the DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen) as DSM 13328T.</description>
