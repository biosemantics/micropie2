  <description>Spiroplasma kunkelii sp. nov. Spiroplasma kunkelii (kun.kel’i.i. L. gen. n. kunkelii of Kunkel, after L. 0. Kunkel, to honor his major and fundamental contributions to the study of plant mollicutes) cells are pleomorphic, varying from helical filaments 100 to 150 nm in diameter and 3 to 10 um long to nonhelical filaments or spherical cells 300 to 800 nm in diameter. The cells lack true cell walls and periplasmic fibrils. Motile. Colonies on solid medium containing 0.8% Noble agar are usually diffuse, rarely exhibiting central zones of growth into agar. Colonies on solid C-3G medium containing 5% horse serum or on media containing 2.25% Noble agar frequently have a fried egg morphology. Chemoorganotroph. Acid produced from glucose. Hydrolyzes arginine. Does not hydrolyze urea. Reduction to tetrazolium variable. Phosphatase negative. Film and spot reaction positive. No liquefaction of coagulated serum. Agar colonies do not hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Cholesterol is required for growth.  Facultative anaerobe. Temperature range, 20 to 32°C; optimum temperature, 30 to 32°C. Isolated from maize displaying symptoms of corn stunt disease and from leafhoppers associated with diseased maize, largely in the neotropics. Pathogenicity for plants and insects has been experimentally verified. The G+C content of the DNA is 26 +/- 1 mol%. Genome molecular weight, lo9. The type strain is strain E275 (= ATCC 29320).</description>
