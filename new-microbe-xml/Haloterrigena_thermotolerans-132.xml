  <description>Cells are rod-shaped, 4-13 µm by 0.7-1.0 µm.  Nonmotile.  Require at least 2 M NaCl for growth.  Cells lyse in less than 1 M NaCl.  Optimum NaCl concentration for growth is 3.0-3.5 M.  Magnesium requirement low, with optimal growth and normal morphology being obtained in 5 mM Mg2+.  Colonies are circular, entire, convex, opaque, pale red, 0.5-1.0 mm in diameter.  Chemo-organotrophic, strictly aerobic.  Nitrogen and carbon source: Casamino acids.  Sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose, ribose and others) and glycerol are not used as carbon sources and do not give rise to acid production.  Does not produce amylase.  Reduces nitrate to nitrite.  Does not grow anaerobically in the presence of nitrate or l-arginine.  Liquefaction of gelatin weak.  Tween 80 hydrolysed.  Does not produce indole.  Oxidase- and catalase-positive.  Possesses C20C20 and C20C25 diether core lipids.  Polar lipids are PG, PGP-Me and S2-DGD-1 as sole or main glycolipid.  PGS absent or below detection limit.  Growth in the pH range 6.5-8.2; optimum 7.0-7.5.  Temperature optimum 50 °C; weak growth is possible up to 60 °C.  Sensitive to anisomycin, bacitracin, novobiocin, vibriostatic agent (O/129) and sulfamethazone plus trimethoprim.  Insensitive to ampicillin, penicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, neomycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, kanamycin and vancomycin.  The G+C content of the DNA is 63.3 mol% (HPLC).  Type strain : PR5T, isolated from a saltern crystallizer pond in Puerto Rico, was deposited as DSM 11552T (=ATCC 700275T).</description>
