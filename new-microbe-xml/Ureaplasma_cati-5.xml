  <description>Ureaplasma cati sp. nov. Cells are coccoid or coccobacillary, but occasional filaments are seen. Nonmotile. Optimal temperature, 36 +/- 1Â°C. Optimal pH, 6.0 to 7.0. Colonies are tiny, 15 to 140 um in diameter, and usually granular in appearance; occasionally fried-egg morphology is seen. Growth is retarded by 0.05% thallium acetate but not by penicillins. All strains hydrolyze urea with production of ammonia. Arginine and the usual carbohydrates are not metabolized. All strains examined thus far have been isolated from oropharygeal cavities of domestic cats. The type strain is serologically distinct from the type strains of U. urealyticum, U. diversum, U. gallorale, and U. felinum sp. nov. and from the unidentified ureaplasma serogroups isolated from simian, ovine, caprine, and canine sources.  The type strain, strain F2 (= ATCC 49228), is also genomically distinct from the type strains of the three previously established species and U. felinum sp. nov. as determined by [3H]DNA-DNA hybridization and DNA cleavage patterns. The PAGE polypeptide patterns are also distinct from the patterns of these four species.</description>
