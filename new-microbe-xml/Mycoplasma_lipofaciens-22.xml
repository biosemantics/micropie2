  <description>Mycoplasma lipofaciens sp. nov. Thin sections show mainly oval and elliptical particles with a triple-layer cell membrane and no cell wall. Average diameter of cells is 520 nm. Cells pass through a filter with 450-nm pores but are retained by 220-nm pores. Filaments and ring forms are produced. Typical fried egg colonies are produced. Cultures are resistant to penicillin and thallium acetate, and no reversion to cell wall forms occurs in the absence of these compounds. Cultures show a positive growth response to cholesterol. Glucose and arginine are utilized, but urea is not. Films and spots are produced on routine and egg yolk agars. Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride is reduced anaerobically but not aerobically. Cultures produce no phosphatase activity, no serum digestion, and no hydrolysis of esculin or arbutin. The species is serologically distinct from other Mycoplasma species. Isolated from the infraorbital sinus of an adult chicken.  Pathogenicity not known, but experimental infection with the type strain has caused some chicken and turkey embryo mortality. The G+C content of the DNA is 24.5 mol%. Type strain: strain R171 (= ATCC 35015 =NCTC 10191).</description>
