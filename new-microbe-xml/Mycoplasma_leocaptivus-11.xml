  <description>Mycoplasma leocaptivus sp. nov. Mycoplasma leocaptivus (1e.o.cap’ti.vus. L.n. leo, lion; L. adj. captivus, captive; M.L. adj. leocaptivus, captive lion). Morphological and physical characteristics. Pleomorphic cells are bounded by a single unit membrane. Colonies have a typical fried-egg appearance on agar. Organisms are filterable through 220-nm-pore-size membrane filters and are resistant to penicillin.  Growth characteristics. Requires sterol; inhibited by digitonin and sodium polyanethol sulfonate. Optimal growth occurs at 35 to 37°C under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. A film is produced on egg yolk agar, and lipolytic activity occurs. Growth is inhibited by 0.002% methylene blue in agar. Metabolic characteristics. Glucose, maltose, mannose, raffinose, and sucrose are metabolized; arginine, esculin, and urea are not hydrolyzed; resazurin and tellurite (under anaerobic conditions) are reduced, but methylene blue and tetrazolium are not reduced; phosphatase is produced. Serological characteristics.  Serologically distinct from all other Mycoplasma species. DNA base composition. The DNA base composition is 27 mol% G+C. Habitat. The habitat is lion and leopard throats.Type strain. The type strain is strain 3L2 (= NCTC 11726).</description>
