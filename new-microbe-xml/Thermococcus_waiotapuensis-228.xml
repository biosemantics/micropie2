  <description>Coccoid-shaped and flagellated cells between 0.7 and 1.5 µm in diameter.  Obligately anaerobic.  Temperature range for growth from 60 to 90 °C; optimum at 85 °C.  Range of growth from pH 5.0 to 8.0, with the optimum at around pH 7.0.  Optimum NaCl concentration was 5.4 g per liter (5.4%), and growth was supported at NaCl concentrations lower than 14 g per liter.  Strictly heterotrophic, growing optimally on peptone, tryptone, yeast extract, beef extract, and nonhydrolyzed casein.  Growth is also supported by a defined mixture of amino acids.  Starch, maltose, and pyruvate can be utilized.  Growth occurs in the presence of elemental sulfur, although it can be substituted by cystine or thioglycollate.  DNA G+C content is 50.4 mol%.  Isolated from Waiotapu, a terrestrial, freshwater hot spring in New Zealand.  Type strain Thermococcus waiotapuensis WT1 (DSM 12768).  No autotrophic growth was detected.  Unable to use sucrose, glucose, cellobiose, citrate, glycerol, lactate, acetate, olive oil, and CO2, casamino acids.  No growth in the absence of elemental sulfur, cystine, or thioglycollate.  Sensitive to rifampicin.</description>
