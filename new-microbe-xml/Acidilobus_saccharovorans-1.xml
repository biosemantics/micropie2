  <description>Exhibits the following properties in addition to those given in the genus description.  Cells are regular to irregular cocci, 1–2 µm in diameter.  Growth occurs at 60–90 ˚C (optimum, 80–85 ˚C) and at pH 2.5–5.8 (optimum, 3.5–4.0).  Strictly anaerobic.  Heterotrophic.  Growth occurs on yeast extract, peptone, starch, glucose, lactose, maltose, sucrose, fructose, galactose, lichenan, laminarin, arbutin, amygdalin and xylan.  Elemental sulfur and thiosulfate stimulate growth on yeast extract but are not obligately required.  Growth product from sugars are acetate, ethanol, lactate and, in the presence of S˚, H2S.  The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 54.5 mol%.  The type strain, 345-15T (=DSM 16705T=VKM B-2471T), was isolated from a hot acidic pool in the Orange Thermal Field of Uzon Caldera, Kamchatka, Russia. No growth occurred with acetate, arabinose, cellulose, formate, glycine, gelatin, gum guar, malate, methanol, pectin, pyruvate, propionate, trehalose, ribose, xylose, fumarate, microcrystalline cellulose, glycine or succinate.  Growth occurs on beef extract, soya extract, and galactose.  Resistant to chloramphenicol, penicillin, and streptomycin.  Lipids included GDGT-3 (3 cylopentane rings), GDGT-4 and GDGT-4’, isocrenarchaeol GDGT-5’, GDGT-6, and GDGT-6’.</description>
