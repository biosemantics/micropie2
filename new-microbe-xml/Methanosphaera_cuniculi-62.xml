  <description>Cells are round, 0.6 to 1.2 µm in diameter, gram positive, nonmotile, and usually occur in pairs.  Cell walls are composed of pseudomurein and contain serine.  The optimum temperature is 35 to 40°C, and the optimum pH is 6.8.  The organism is anaerobic.  Colonies are circular or elliptical, yellowish, and about 1 mm in diameter and have entire edges.  Both hydrogen and methanol are required for growth.  No growth occurs with H2-CO2 alone or under a N2-CO2 atmosphere in media containing methanol or acetate.  No growth occurs under a H2-CO2 or a N2-CO2 atmosphere in media containing ethanol, isopropanol, methylamines, or formate.  Acetate is required for growth but does not support methane production.  The DNA G+C content is 23 mol%.  The type strain, isolated from rabbit rectums, is 1R7 (DSM4103).</description>
