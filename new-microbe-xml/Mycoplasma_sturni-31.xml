  <description>Mycoplasma sturni sp. nov. Mycoplasma sturni (stur'ni. M. L. n. Sturnus, a genus of birds; M. L. gen. n. sturni, of the genus Sturnus, the genus of the bird from which the organism was isolated). Most cells are coccoid and have sizes ranging from 300 to 500 nm, but some irregular flask-shaped and filamentous forms also occur. All cells lack a cell wall. Colonies on solid medium usually have a fried-egg appearance. Chemoorganotroph. Grows rapidly in broth medium, with acid production from glucose. Does not hydrolyze arginine or urea. Cholesterol or serum is required for growth. The optimum temperature for growth is 34 to 37"C, and growth does not occur at 42Â°C. Serologically distinct from previously described Mycoplasma species. Isolated from ocular tissues of a starling (S. vulgaris) with conjunctivitis, but it has not been determined whether the organism plays a pathogenic role in avian disease. The G+C content of the DNA is 31 mol%, and the genome size, as determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, is 870 kbp. The type strain is strain UCMF (= ATCC 51945).</description>
