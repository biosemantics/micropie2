  <file>Thermococcus.sp.AM4.pdf</file>
  <description>The first lithotrophic Thermococcales isolate described and the first Archaeal isolate to exhibit a capacity for hydrogenogenic carboxydotrophy.  Isolated from hydrothermal venting structures on the East Pacific Rise.  Grows anaerobically on CO at 80ËšC with the production of H2 and CO2.  Carboxydotrophic growth required the presence of yeast extract.  In the absence of CO, AM4 could grow on peptone or yeast extract with elemental sulfur as the electron acceptor.</description>
