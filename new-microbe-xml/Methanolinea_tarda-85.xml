  <description>Strictly anaerobic.  Cells are non-motile and rod-shaped, 0.7–1.0 µm wide and 2.0 µm long.  Cells often form multicellular filaments longer than 8 µm in syntrophic propionate-degrading enrichment culture.  Gram-reaction negative.  H2 and formate can be used for growth and methane production.  Yeast extract and acetate are required for growth.  Pyruvate, lactate, acetate, proionate, trimethylamine, dimethylamine, methylamine, cyclopentanol, ethanol, methanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, and 2-butanol did not support growth and methane production.  The temperature range for growth is 35–55 ˚C (optimum 50 ˚C).  The pH range for growth is 6.7–8.0 (optimum pH 7.0).  Under optimum conditions, the growth rate is approx. 0.17 per day.  Growth occurs in the presence of 0–1.5% NaCl but does not occur in the presence of 2.0% NaCl.  The G+C content of the DNA of the type strain is 56.3 mol%.  The type strain, NOBI-1T (=DSM 16494T =JCM 12467T =NBRC 102358T), was isolated from a mesophilic, methanogenic sludge digesting sewage sludge.</description>
