  <file>Cells polymorphous disks and dishes, about 0.3-2.5 µm in diameter and usually 0.2 µm thick.  Networks of cannulae formed.  Growth by hydrogen-sulfur autotrophy, or in the presence of yeast extract, on H2/CO2 and sulfite.  Optimal growth temperature around 105˚C.  Growth between 0.2-12% NaCl and pH 4.5-7.2.  The mol % G+C of the DNA is 62 (Tm).  Chemolithotrophic.  H2S is formed from sulfur and hydrogen.  Non-motile.  Strictly anaerobic.</file>
