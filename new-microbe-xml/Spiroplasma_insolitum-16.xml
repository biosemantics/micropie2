  <description>Spiroplasma insolitum sp. nov. Spiroplasma insolitum (in.so.li‘tum. L. adj. insolitus, unusual or uncommon; insolitum to denote unusual base composition) cells in logarithmic phase are long, motile, helical filaments that lack true cell walls. Filterable through 220-nm membranes. Form diffuse colonies on solid medium with 0.8% Noble agar, without fried-egg morphology. Chemoorganotroph. Acid produced from glucose. Does not utilize urea or catabolize arginine. Film and spot reaction negative. Does not hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Sterol requirement met by serum. Temperature range, 15 to 37°C; doubling time at 30°C optimum is 7.2 h. Serologically distinct from other Spiroplasma groups but cross-reacts in complex patterns of relatedness with group I subgroups. Isolated in 1981 from a fall flower (Compositae: Bidens sp.) collected in Maryland. Similar isolates found in the hemocoel of click beetles (Coleoptera: Elateridae).  Also isolated from other composite and onagracead flowers and from the guts of many insects visiting these flowers, including cantharid and meloid beetles; bombyliid and syrphid flies; andrenid and megachilid bees; and danaid, papilionid, pierid, and yponomeutid butterflies. Pathogenicity for insects not determined. The G+C content of the DNA is 28   +/- 1 mol%, as determined by buoyant density. The genome size is 1,850 kbp (1,233 MDa). The type strain is M55 (ATCC 33502).</description>
