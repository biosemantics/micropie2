  <description>Displays the following properties in addition to those given in the emended genus description.  Cells are 0.5–1.5 µm in diameter.  Growth is obligately chemolithotrophic.  Good growth occurs under aerobic conditions on elemental sulfur, ferrous iron, pyrite and other mineral sulfides (chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite).  Under anaerobic conditions, ferric iron or elemental sulfur serve as the terminal electron acceptor for growth via oxidation of H2S.  Cells do not grow using elemental sulfur as a terminal electron acceptor for oxidation of H2.  Cells are facultatively autotrophic, as they grow when provided with CO2 as the sole source of carbon and heterotrophically using yeast extract or meat extract as a carbon source.  Cells do not grow organotrophically.  Cells grow over a range of temperatures from 45 to 83 ˚C, with optimum growth at 74 ˚C.  The pH range for growth is 0.35–3.0, with optimal growth at pH 0.8–1.4.  Optimal growth occurs at up to 0.5% (w/v) NaCl.  The DNA G+C content is 31.1 mol%.  Cell membrane lipids consist of a mixture of GDGTs and glycerol dialkyl calditol tetraethers, most of which are cyclized tetraethers.  The type strain, JP7T (=DSM 18786T=JCM 13667T), was isolated from the sulfur-rich acidic edge of a solfataric hot spring.  Did not grow by oxidizing H2 or by reducing S˚.  Did not grow on glucose, sucrose, cellobiose, gelatin, yeast extract, meat extract, and tryptone.</description>
