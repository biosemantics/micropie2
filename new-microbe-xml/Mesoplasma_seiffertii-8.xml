  <description>Mesoplasma seiffertii sp. nov. Mesoplasma seiffertii (seif.fer’ti.i. N. L. gen. n. seiffertii, of Seiffert, in honor of Gustav Seiffert, a German microbiologist who performed pioneer studies of sterol-nonrequiring mollicutes that occur in soil and compost.) Cells are primarily of coccoid shape, varying in diameter from 300 to 500 nm. Cells lack true cell walls. Nonmotile. Colonies on solid medium containing 0.8% Noble agar usually have the appearance of fried eggs. Chemoorganotroph. Acid produced from glucose and mannose. Does not hydrolyze arbutin, arginine, or urea. Agar colonies hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Cholesterol or serum not required for growth. Temperature range for growth, 20 to 35°C; optimum growth occurs at 28°C. Serologically distinct from previously described Mesoplasma and Acholeplasma species. Isolated from floral surfaces of a sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) in Morocco and wild angelica (Angelica sylvestris) in France, but the true habitat is not known.   Pathogenicity for plants or insects has not been determined. The average genome molecular mass is 886 MDa. The G+C content of the DNA is 30 +/- 1 mol%, as determined by the buoyant density method. The type strain is strain F7 (= ATCC 49495).</description>
