  <description>Isolated from anoxic sediments of Baldegger Lake (Switzerland). The cell morphology of strain ZB never formed aggregates.  Only packets of 3–4 cells were observed.  The cells in the packets were nonmotile irregular cocci with a diameter of 1.0–1.7 µm.  Metabolized methanol, monomethylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, methanethiol, and dimethyl sulfide.  Did not metabolize H2/CO2, formate, 2-propanol/CO2, 2-butanol/CO2, or acetate.  Non-motile.  Temperature range 1-38˚C, with temperature optimum of 30˚C.</description>
