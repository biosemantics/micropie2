  <description>Cells are motile, rod-shaped (0.9–1.0 x 3.6–6.4 µm) and Gram-negative.  Colonies on agar plates containing 2.6 M NaCl are red, elevated and round.  Chemo-organotrophic and aerobic.  Growth occurs at NaCl concentrations of 1.7–4.3 M, at pH 7.0–9.0 and at temperatures of 25–52 ˚C.  Optimal NaCl concentration, pH and temperature for growth are 2.6 M, pH 7.5 and 40–42 ˚C, respectively.  Catalase- and oxidase-positive.  Anaerobic growth with nitrate, arginine or DMSO does not occur.  Nitrate reduction to nitrite is observed.  H2S is not produced from Na2S2O3.  Positive for indole formation.  Tweens 20, 40, 60 and 80 are hydrolysed.  Casein and starch are not hydrolysed.  Gelatin is not liquefied.  Glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose, sucrose, maltose and mannitol are utilized and acids are produced.  No growth or acid production is observed on sorbose, xylose, lactose, D-ribose or sorbitol.  Sensitive to rifampicin, bacitracin and novobiocin.  Resistant to erythromycin, neomycin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, penicillin G, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, kanamycin, tetracycline and vancomycin.  Cells contain C20–C20 derivatives of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate and phosphatidylglycerol phosphate sulfate.  Sulfated mannosyl-glucosyl glycerol diether was not detected.  The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 64.2 mol% (Tm).  The type strain, 31-hongT (=CGMCC 1.2670T=JCM 13560T), was isolated from Aiding salt lake in Xin-Jiang, China.</description>
