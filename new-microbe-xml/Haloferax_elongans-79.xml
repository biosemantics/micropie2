  <description>Cells are pleomorphic, with irregular short rods and pleomorphic forms common during stationary phase and in suboptimal media.  During exponential growth under optimum conditions, cells elongate to up to 12 µm long.  Rotational motility is observed in elongated cells Gram-negative.  Colonies on complex agar medium are small (1–2 mm diameter), red, entire, translucent and convex.  Growth occurs in 1.7–5.1 M NaCl, with optimum growth at 2.6–3.4 M NaCl.  Growth occurs in media containing at least 0.2 M Mg2+ or more, with an optimum of 0.4 M.  At least 0.04 M Mg2+ is required for maintenance of native cell morphology and cell lysis occurs in NaCl solutions of less than 0.85 M.  Grows at pH 7.0–9.0 and 30– 55 ˚C, with optimum growth at pH 7.4 and 53 ˚C.  The generation time at 53 ˚C is 32±3 min.  Chemo-organotrophic.  Aerobic.  Oxidase-variable and catalase-positive.  Nitrate is not reduced to nitrite.  Does not produce gas from nitrate.  Indole is produced from tryptophan.  H2S is not produced from thiosulfate.  Anaerobic growth is not observed with either nitrate, DMSO or arginine.  Gelatin, casein, starch and Tween 80 are hydrolysed.  The following substrates are used as carbon sources: glucose, glycerol, maltose, sucrose and trehalose.  Acid is produced from glucose, glycerol, maltose, sucrose and trehalose.  The following substrates are not used as carbon sources: ethanol, fumarate, galactose, glycine, lactose, mannitol, mannose, raffinose, xylose, L-arginine, L-histidine, L-lysine, L-ornithine and D-sorbitol.  Sensitive to novobiocin (50 µg per mL).  Resistant to ampicillin, bacitracin, chloramphenicol, cycloheximide, erythromycin, gentamicin, neomycin, penicillin, streptomycin and tetracycline (all at 50 µg per mL), ciprofloxacin (2.5 µg per disk), norfloxacin (10 µg per disk) and rifampicin (1 µg per disk).  Lipids S-DGA-1, diglycosyl archaeol-1 (DGA-1), phosphatidylglycerophosphate methyl ester (PGP-Me) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) are present, but PGS is not present.  The type strain is SA5T (=JCM 14791T=ATCC BAA- 1513T=UNSW 104100T), isolated from a smooth mat, Hamelin Pool, Shark Bay, Western Australia.  The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 61.4 mol%.</description>
