  <description>Spiroplasma alleghenense sp. nov. Spiroplasma alleghenense (al.le.ghen.en’se. M.L. n. alleghenense, of the Allegheny Mountains, referring to the geographic origin of the type strain, the range of the Appalachian Mountains from which it was derived). Cells are helical, motile filaments that vary from 100 to 30 nm in diameter. The cells lack true cell walls. Colonies on SP-4 solid medium containing 3.0% Noble agar are small and granular and never have a fried-egg appearance. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Hydrolyzes arginine but not urea. Cholesterol or serum is required for growth. The temperature range for growth is 10 to 32C, and optimum growth occurs at 32°C. The doubling time at the optimum temperature in M1D medium is 6.4 h. Serologically distinct from other established Spiroplasma species. Isolated from the hemolymph of a common scorpion fly, Panorpa helena. Pathogenicity for insects has not been determined. The G+C content of the DNA is 31 +/- 1 mol%, and the genome size is 1,465 kbp. The type strain is PLHS-1 (= ATCC 51742).</description>
