  <reference>Ignicoccus gen. nov., a novel genus of hyperthermophilic, chemolithoautotrophic Archaea, represented by two new species, Ignicoccus islandicus sp. nov. and Ignicoccus pacificus sp. nov. IJSEM 50:2093-2100</reference>

  <description>Slightly irregular cocci, about 1-2 µm in diameter, monopolar polytrichous flagella.  Gram-negative.  Occurring singly and in pairs.  No evidence for a regular arrayed surface protein.  Growth between 75 and 98 °C, pH 4.5-7.0 and 1.0-5.0% NaCl; optima are 90 °C, pH 6 and 2% NaCl.  Strictly anaerobic.  Chemolithoautotrophic growth in the presence of H2 and CO2 with sulfur as electron acceptor.  No chemo-organotrophic growth on meat extract, yeast extract, peptone, Casamino acids, gelatin, starch, formate, acetate or glucose.  Sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate, tetrathionate and nitrate are not used as electron acceptors.  H2S formed during growth.  Growth stimulated by addition of 0.1% meat extract, tryptone, gelatin or yeast extract.  Type strain is isolate LPC33T (=DSM 13166T= ATCC 700958T), isolated from black smoker samples at 9° N, 104° W in the Pacific Ocean.  Cells contain phytanyl di- and tetraether lipids. Ampicillin-, rifampicin- and vancomycin-resistant.</description>
