  <description>Mesoplasma photuris sp. nov. Mesoplasma photuris (pho.tur’is. M. L. gen. n. photuris, of Photuris, referring to the genus of firefly beetle [Photuris sp. from which the organism was first isolated). Cells are primarily coccoid, ranging in diameter from 300 to 500 nm. Cells lack true cell walls. Nonmotile. Colonies on solid medium containing 0.8% Noble agar usually have the appearance of fried eggs. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Hydrolyzes arginine but not urea. Agar colonies do not hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Cholesterol or serum is not required for growth, but growth in serum-free media depends on the presence of 0.04% Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan). The temperature range for growth is 10 to 32°C; optimum growth occurs at 30°C. Serologically distinct from other Mesoplasma species. Isolated from larval and adult gut fluids of fireflies (Photuris lucicrescens and other Photuris spp.) (Coleoptera: Lampyridae) in Maryland.  Pathogenicity for plants and insects has not been determined. The average genome size is 825 kbp. The G+C content of the DNA is 28.8 mol%, as determined by Bd, T, and  HPLC methods. The type strain is PUPA-2 (= ATCC 49581).</description>
