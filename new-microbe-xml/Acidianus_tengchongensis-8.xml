  <file>Acidianus.tengchongensis.pdf</file>
  <description>Cells are Gram-negative, irregular cocci, with diameter of 1.2 µm.  Thermoacidophilic, facultatively anaerobic.  Obligate chemolithotrophy, utilizing CO2 as carbon source with either S˚ and O2 (yielding sulfuric acid) or S˚ and H2 (yielding H2S) as energy sources.  Thiosulfate is also used for energy.  The optimal pH and temperature for growth are 2.5 (range 1.0–5.5) and 70°C (range 55°C–80°C), respectively.  Isolated from an acidothermal spring in Tengchong of Yunnan province of China.  The type strain is Acidianus tengchongensis S5T, deposited in the China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (Collection number: AS 1.3347), Beijing.  No growth on ribose, arabinose, xylose, glucose, galactose, maltose, lactose, sucrose, melibiose, raffinose, cellulose, starch, mannitol, 20 different amino acids, yeast extract, tryptone, peptone, and beef extract.  Incapable of using ferrous iron as an energy source.</description>
