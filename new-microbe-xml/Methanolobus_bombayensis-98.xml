  <description>Cells are irregular, nonmotile coccoids (diameter, 1 to 1.5 µm) and occur singly.  Gram negative.  Lysed by 0.1 g of sodium dodecyl sulfate per liter.  Surface colonies are circular, convex, translucent, and colorless with entire margins and have diameters of 2 to 3 mm after 7 to 10 days of incubation.  The catabolic substrates used include methanol, trimethylamine, and dimethyl sulfide, but not formate, acetate, or H2-CO2.  Grows in mineral medium containing a catabolic substrate; yeast extract and peptones are highly stimulatory.  Sodium and magnesium are required for growth.  Fastest growth occurs in the presence of 0.5 M Na+ and &gt;0.03 M Mg2+ at pH 7.2 and 37°C.  The guanine-plus-cytosine content of the DNA is 39.2 mol% (as determined by chromatographic analysis of bases).  The habitat is marine sediments.  The type strain is strain B-1 (= OCM 438), which was isolated from Arabian Sea sediments obtained near Bombay, India.</description>
