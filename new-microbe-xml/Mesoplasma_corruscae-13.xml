  <description>Mesoplasma corruscae sp. nov. Mesoplasma corruscue (cor.rus’cae. M. L. fem. gen. n. corruscae, of corruscu, referring to the species of firefly beetle [Ellychnia corrusca] from which the organism was first isolated). Cells are primarily coccoid, ranging in diameter from 300 to 500 nm. Cells lack true cell walls. Nonmotile. Colonies on solid medium containing 0.8% Noble agar usually have the appearance of fried eggs. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Does not hydrolyze arginine or urea. Agar colonies hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Cholesterol or serum is not required for growth, but growth in serum-free media depends on the presence of 0.04% Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan). The temperature range for growth is 10 to 32°C; optimum growth occurs at 30°C. Serologically distinct from other Mesoplasma species. Isolated from the gut of an adult firefly (Ellychnia corrusca) (Coleoptera: Lampyridae) in Maryland. Pathogenicity for plants and insects has not been determined. The average genome size is 920 kbp. The G+C content of the DNA is 26.4 mol%, as determined by Bd, T, and HPLC methods. The type strain is ELCA-2 (= ATCC 49579).</description>
