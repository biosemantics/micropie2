  <description>Cells are nonmotile cocci that are 1 to 2 µm in diameter and occur mostly in irregular clusters.  Colonies are circular and orange-red.  Cell lysis does not occur in distilled water.  Extremely halophilic; growth occurs in the presence of NaCl concentrations between 8 and 30% and optimum growth occurs in the presence of 15 to 20% NaCl.  The temperature range for growth is 22 to 50°C, and the optimum temperature is 40 to 45°C.  The pH range for growth is 8.0 to 10.0, and the optimum pH is around 9.0.  The polar lipids consist of C20C20 and C20C25 derivatives of phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerophosphate.  Does not contain phosphatidylglycero-(cyclo-)phosphate.  Chemoorganotrophic.  Obligatory aerobic.  Nitrate and nitrite reduction positive.  Starch is hydrolyzed.  Gelatin is not liquefied.  Susceptible to anisomycin, bacitracin, erythromycin, novobiocin, and tetracycline.  Resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, polymyxin B, and streptomycin.  The G+C content of the DNA is 63.5 mol%.  Inhabits a Kenyan soda lake, Lake Magadi.  The type strain is Natronococcus amylolyticus Ah-36 (= JCM 9655).</description>
