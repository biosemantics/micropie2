  <description>Regular or highly irregular cells, depending on the salt concentration in the medium.  Average size 3 µm in diameter, peritrichous flagellated.  Cells are Gram negative and the cell envelope is composed of hexagonal protein subunits, which seem to contain a glycoprotein of MW  = 120,000.  DNA base composition: 54 mol% G + C.  Growth temperatures: 25-45˚C, optimum between 37-40˚C.  Optimal salt concentration: 0.1 M NaCl.  Growth and methane production on H2:CO2 and formate.  0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% peptone and acetate are required for optimal growth.  Yeast extract and peptone can partially be replaced by a heavy metal solution.  Found in solfataric pools at an altitude of 4750 m.  No growth on acetate, methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine.  Type strain: DSM 2702.</description>
