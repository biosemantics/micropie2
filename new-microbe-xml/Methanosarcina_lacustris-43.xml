  <description>Isolated from anoxic sediments of a pond polluted with paper-mill waste water of the Syktyvkar Forest Industry Complex.  Had a characteristic sarcina-like cell arrangement and morphology.  The cells of all these strains formed aggregates of varying size.  The aggregates formed by cells were smaller with a diameter of 0.1–0.5 mm.  Metabolized a wide variety of substrates including H2/CO2, methanol, monomethylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, and acetate.  Did not metabolize formate, 2-propanol/CO2, 2-butanol/CO2, methanethiol, or dimethyl sulfide.  Non-motile.  Temperature range 1-32˚C, with temperature optimum of 25˚C.</description>
