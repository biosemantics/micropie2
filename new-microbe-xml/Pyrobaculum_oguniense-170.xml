  <description>The cells are rod-shaped and usually between 2 and 10 µm long and between 0.6 and 1.0 µm wide.  Motile by monopolar flagellation.  Cell wall composed of protein surface layer.  Growth between 70 and 97 °C (optimum, 90-94 °C), at pH 5.4 and 7.4 (optimum pH 6.3-7.0) and up to 1.5% NaCl (w/v) (optimal at 0%).  Optimal doubling time of 180 min under aerobic conditions and 360 min under anaerobic and microaerobic conditions.  Heterotrophic growth with yeast extract and trypticase peptone.  Sulfur inhibits aerobic growth but stimulates anaerobic growth.  Oxygen, thiosulfate, sulfur, l-cystine and glutathione (oxidized form) are possible electron acceptors.  The G+C content of genomic DNA is about 48 mol%.  Isolate obtained from water samples of a terrestrial hot spring (Tuetate hot spring), Oguni-cho, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan.  The type strain is Pyrobaculum oguniense TE7T (=JCM 10595T=DSM 13380T).  Resistant to streptomycin and vancomycin.  Sensitive to rifampicin.  Slightly inhibited by chloramphenicol and penicillin G.  No growth was observed with casein, gelatin, casamino acids, starch, d-l-glucose, sucrose, lactose, maltose, sodium acetate or sodium pyruvate as the sole carbon source.  Na2SO3 (0.1%) and S˚ (1%) inhibited aerobic growth.  H2S was not formed under aerobic conditions.  No growth was observed under anaerobic conditions in the presence of NaNO2 or NaNO3.  Autotrophic growth was not observed under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions.</description>
