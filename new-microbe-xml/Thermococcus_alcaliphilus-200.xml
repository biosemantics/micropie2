  <description>Cells are coccoid-shaped, 0.8 to 1.3 µm in diameter.  Obligately anaerobic.  Temperature range for growth from 56 to 90˚C optimum around 85˚C.  Range of growth from pH 6.5 to 10.5 with the optimum around pH 9.0; growth from 1 to 6% NaC1 with an optimum around 2-3%.  Strictly heterotrophic.  Yeast extract, peptone, meat extract, tryptone, and casein are fermented.  Growth is not inhibited by H2.  Growth with and without polysulfide or sulfur with a significant stimulation of the growth rate in the presence of polysulfide or sulfur.  Fermentation products (on yeast extract with sulfur) are isovalerate, isobutyrate, propionate, acetate, CO2, NH3, and H2S.  In the absence of sulfur, H2 is formed.  G+C content of DNA is approximately 42 mol%.  Core lipids consist of tetraether and diphytanyl.  Isolated from a shallow marine hydrothermal system at Vulcano Island, Italy.  Type strain Thermococcus alcaliphilus AEDII12 (DSM 10322).  Growth was obtained on yeast extract, peptone, meat extract, tryptone, and casein.  No growth was observed on casamino acids, glucose, fructose, xylose, lactose, maltose, saccharose, xylane, or starch.  The growth rate was enhanced by the addition of polysulfide or elemental sulfur to the medium.  During growth the absorbance of polysulfide decreased and H2S was formed.  Isovalerate, isobutyrate, propionate, acetate and H2S were formed as metabolic products.</description>
