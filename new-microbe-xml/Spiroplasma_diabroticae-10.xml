  <description>Spiroplasma diabroticae sp. nov. Spiroplasma diabroticae (di.a.bro’ti.cae. M.L. gen. n. diabroticae, from Diabrotica undecimpunctata, the chrysomelid beetle from which the organism was isolated). Cells are filamentous, helical, and motile, vary from 200 to 300 nm in diameter, and lack true cell walls. Colonies on solid medium supplemented with 0.8% agar are diffuse, without fried-egg morphology. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Does not hydrolyze arginine or urea. Sterol is not required for sustained growth. The temperature range is 10 to 41°C; the optimum temperature is 32°C. Serologically distinct from other established Spiroplasma species, groups, and subgroups. Isolated from the hemolymph of an adult chrysomelid beetle, D. undecimpunctata howardii. The G+C content of the DNA is 25 +/- 1 mol%, and the genome size is 1,350 kbp. The type strain is DU-1 (= ATCC 43210).</description>
