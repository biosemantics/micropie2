  <description>Regular or slightly irregular cocci (3-5 µm diam.) with a tuft of filaments, which are 40 µg in length.  Growth between 70° and 95°C at neutral to slightly alkaline pH values.  Strictly anaerobic, fermentative growth.  Growth inhibited by elemental sulfur.  Membrane lipids consist exclusively of dibiphytanylglycerol tetraethers.  Respiratory lipoquinones are absent.  No murein.  DNA G+C content between 54 and 56 mol%.  Tends to form higher aggregates and adsorb to amorphous particles in the medium.  Optimal growth at 85°C, pH 7.5.  Strictly anaerobic fermentative growth on yeast extract.  Unable to grow on peptone, starch, casamino acids, glucose, ethanol, acetate, xylan or cellulose.  Growth inhibited by elemental sulfur.  DNA G+C content: 54.7 mol% (Tm).  16S rDNA sequence analysis:  Habitat: hot alkaline springs of Iceland.  Type strain: strain K1, deposited at the DSMZ under the number DSM 11193.  Resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin and rifampin.</description>
