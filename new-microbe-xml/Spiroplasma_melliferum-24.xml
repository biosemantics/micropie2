  <description>Spiroplasma melliferum sp. nov. Spiroplasma melliferum (mel.lif.'er.um. M .L .adj .melliferum specific epithet of the honeybee [Apis mellifera], referring to the insect host) cells are pleomorphic, varying from helical filaments that are 100 to 150 nm in diameter and 3 to 10 um long to nonhelical filaments or spherical cells that are 300 to 800 nm in diameter. Cells lack true cell walls and periplasmic fibrils. Motile. Colonies on solid medium supplemented with 0.8% Noble agar are usually diffuse, rarely exhibiting central zones of growth into agar. Colonies on solid medium containing 2.25% Noble agar are smaller, but frequently have a fried egg morphology. Chemoorganotroph. Acid produced from glucose and mannose. Hydrolyzes arginine. Does not hydrolyze urea. Reduction of tetrazolium variable. Phosphatase negative. Film and spot reaction positive. No liquefaction of coagulated serum. Agar colonies do not hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Cholesterol required for growth. Facultative anaerobe.  Temperature range, 20 to 37°C; temperature optimum, 32 to 35°C. Isolated from hemolymph and gut of honeybees (A. mellifera) in widely separated geographic regions. Also recovered from hemolymph of bumble bees, leafcutter bees, and a robber fly and the intestinal contents of sweat bees, digger bees, bumblebees, and a butterfly. Pathogenic for honeybees in natural and experimental oral infections. Also recovered from a variety of plant surfaces (flowers) in widely separated geographic regions. The G+C content of the DNA is 26 mol% as determined by the melting temperature method and 27 to 28 mol% as determined by the buoyant density method. The genome molecular weight: is lo9. Type strain: strain BC-3 (= ATCC 33219).</description>
