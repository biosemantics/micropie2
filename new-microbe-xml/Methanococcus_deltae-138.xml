  <description>Irregular cocci, cell diameter 1.0-1.5 µm.  Non-motile.  Cell walls sensitive to 0.001% SDS and distilled water.  Colonial morphology: Circular, shiny, greenish-yellow with dark centers, convex.  DNA G + C content: 40.5 mol%.  Growth temperature optimum: 37 ˚C, range 30- 45 ˚C.  Physiology: Strict anaerobe, CO2 plus H2, and formate serve as substrates for growth and methane production.  Phenol red not reduced.  Nutrition: Obligate marine methanogen, requires 3 % NaCl for growth, optimum NaCl concentration is 3.5 - 4.0 %.  Acetate, trypticase, yeast extract, vitamins not required for growth.  Type strain: ARC.  The description of the type strain is the same as for the species.  Did not grow on methanol, methylamine, acetate, yeast extract, trypticase, and vitamins.</description>
