  <description>Five glucose-fermenting Mycoplasma strains were isolated from the pharynx of dogs. Biological and serological studies demonstrated that this group of mycoplasmas was different from the established canine species and from other glucose-fermenting Mycoplasma species of animal or human origin. The isolates appear to constitute a new species, for which the name Mycoplasma molare is proposed ( L . adj. molaris, millstone-like; intended to refer to the heavy film reaction produced by the strains which resembles the pattern on the surface of a millstone). The type strain of M. molare is H 542 (=ATCC 27746; =NCTC 10144).</description>
