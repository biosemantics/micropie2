  <description>Colonies are circular, white, opaque, raised at the centres, have rough surfaces and entire margins and are up to 1 mm in diameter.  The cells are rods, 0.4-0.5 µm wide by 2-10 µm long, occurring individually or in pairs, rarely in chains and small aggregates.  Gram-positive.  Non-motile.  Methanogenic.  Obligatory member of the Euryarchaeota of the domain Archaea.  H2/CO2 is the only substrate that supports growth.  Methane is produced from 2-propanol/CO2, 2-butanol/CO2, and cyclopentanol/CO2 without growth.  Formate, acetate, methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, isobutanol, 1-butanol, pentanol, methylamine and trimethylamine are not used.  Growth factors such as yeast extract, bio-Trypcase and vitamins are not required.  The optimum growth temperature is between 37 and 42 °C.  No growth occurs at 25 or 50 °C.  The optimum pH is 7.2; no growth occurs at pH 5.9 or 8.2.  The doubling time under optimal growth conditions is 7.5 h. The DNA base composition is 39.5±0.3 mol% G+C (as determined by HPLC). Isolated from an anaerobic digester used for the treatment of cassava peel in the Congo (Central Africa). The type strain is strain CT (=DSM 7095T=OCM 779T).</description>
