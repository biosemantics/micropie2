  <description>Acholeplasma vituli [vi.tu«li. L. n. vitulus calf ; L. gen. n. vituli of calf, referring to the provenance of the organism (fetal calf serum)]. Cells predominately coccoid in shape, with mean diameter of about 700 nm. Cells devoid of cell wall and surrounded only by a cytoplasmic membrane. Nonmotile and non-helical. Colonies on solid medium demonstrate typical fried egg appearance under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Chemoorganotroph. Acid produced from glucose, fructose and mannose. Resazurin and tellurite are reduced. Aesculin, arginine and urea are not hydrolysed. Methylene blue and tetrazolium are not reduced. Casein is not digested. Phosphatase and urease are not produced. No film produced on egg yolk agar and no lipolytic activity observed. Sterol or serum not required for growth. Temperature range of growth is 25 to 37 °C. Haemolytic for guinea pig, chick and sheep erythrocytes. Sheep erythrocytes are haemagglutinated. Serologically distinct from all other Acholeplasma and Mycoplasma species.  Isolated so far only from fetal bovine serum or contaminated cell cultures. The DNA G+C content is 38.3 +/- 1 mol% (Bd method) or 37.6 +/- 1 mol% (Tm method). Genome size is 2095 kbp. Type strain is FC 097-2 (ATCC 700667).</description>
