  <description>Spiroplasma penaei (pe.nae'i. N.L. n. Penaeus a genus of penaeid shrimp; N.L. gen. n. penaei of Penaeus vannamei from which the organism was isolated). Cells are helical and motile filaments with a mean diameter of 195 nm. Cells lack true cell walls. Acid is produced from glucose. Temperature range for growth is 20–37°C and optimum growth occurs at 28°C in M1D broth. Serologically distinct from previously characterized Spiroplasma species. Pathogenicity is indicated by injection into P. vannamei. The G+C content of the DNA is 29±1 mol%. The type strain, SHRIMPT (=ATCC BAA-1082T=CAIM 1252T), was isolated from the haemolymph of the Pacific white shrimp, P. vannamei.</description>
