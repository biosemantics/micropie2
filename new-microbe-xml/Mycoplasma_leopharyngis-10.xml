  <description>Mycoplasm leophuryngis sp. nov. Mycoplasma leopharyngis (1e.o.phar.yn’gis. L.n. Zeo, lion; L.n. pharynx, throat; L.n. leopharyngis, pharynx of a lion). Morphological and physical characteristics. Pleomorphic cells are bounded by a single unit membrane. Colonies have a typical fried-egg appearance on agar. Organisms are filterable through 220-nm-pore-size membrane filters and are resistant to penicillin. Growth characteristics. Requires sterol; inhibited by digitonin and sodium polyanethol sulfonate. Optimal growth occurs at 35 to 37°C under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. A film is produced on egg yolk agar, and lipolytic activity occurs. Growth is not inhibited by 0.002% methylene blue in agar. Metabolic characteristics. No carbohydrates are metabolized; arginine, esculin, and urease are not hydrolyzed; resazurin and tellurite (under anaerobic conditions) are reduced, but methylene blue and tetrazolium are not reduced; phosphatase is produced. Serological characteristics.  Serologically distinct from all other Mycoplasma species. DNA base composition. The DNA base composition is 28 mol% G+C. Habitat. The habitat is lion throats. Type strain. The type strain is strain LL2 (= NCTC 11725).</description>
