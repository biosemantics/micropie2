  <description>Cells are coccus-shaped (1.0–1.5 µm) and non-motile, occurring singly, in pairs or irregular clusters.  Cells do not lyse in distilled water.  Stain mainly Gram-negative with some cells Gram-positive in young cultures.  Colonies are 1–2 mm in diameter, orange pigmented, smooth, circular and convex.  Haloalkaliphilic.  Growth occurs in 1.4–5.2 M NaCl (optimum at 3.4 M NaCl), at pH 8.0–10.5 (optimum at pH 9.5–10.0) and at 23–47 ˚C (optimum at 40 ˚C).  Magnesium is not required for growth.  Chemoorganotrophic and strictly aerobic.  Catalase- and oxidase-positive.  Gelatin, starch, casein and Tweens 20, 40, 60 and 80 are not hydrolysed.  Reduces nitrate to nitrite.  Indole is not produced.  H2S is not produced from thiosulfate.  Glucose, lactose, fructose, maltose, sorbose, mannitol, succinate and acetate are used as carbon sources.  Does not use galactose, sucrose, mannose, arabinose, ribose, xylose, rhamnose or raffinose.  Acid is not produced from glucose.  Sensitive to rifampicin and novobiocin, slightly sensitive to chloromycetin and insensitive to penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, ampicillin, polymyxin, bacitracin, neomycin and sulfafurazole.  The polar lipids are C20C20 and C20C25 diether derivatives of PG and PGP-Me without minor phospholipids.  Glycolipids and PGS not detected.  MK-8 is the major isoprenoid quinone; MK-8(H2) is present in smaller amounts.  The type strain is DS12T (=AS 1.3240T=JCM 11890T), which was isolated from Lake Zabuye (soda lake), Tibet, China.  The DNA G+C content of strain DS12T is 61.5 mol% (Tm).</description>
