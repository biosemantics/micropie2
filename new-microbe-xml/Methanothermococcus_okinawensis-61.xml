  <description>Irregular cocci, with a mean diameter of 1.0-1.5 µm.  Cells occur singly or in pairs.  Exhibits vigorous motility with a polar bundle of flagella.  Strictly anaerobic and obligately methanogenic.  The temperature range for growth is 40-75 °C, with the optimum being 60-65 °C.  The pH range for growth is 4.5-8.5, with optimum growth occurring at pH 6-7.  Sea salts are required for growth and the range is 12-96 g per liter, with optimum growth occurring at 20-50 g per liter.  Growth occurs with H2 or formate as an electron donor and CO2 as an electron acceptor and a carbon source.  Acetate, methanol, ethanol, dimethyl sulfide, trimethylamine, yeast extract, peptone, tryptone, casamino acids, and a mixture of 20 amino acids did not support growth in the absence of H2 and did not stimulate growth in the presence of H2 and CO2.  Ammonium serves as a nitrogen source.  Selenium and magnetite (Fe2O3) are stimulatory for growth.  Resistant to ampicillin (200 µg per mL), kanamycin (200 µg per mL), rifampicin (100 µg per mL) and streptomycin (200 µg per mL) but sensitive to chloramphenicol (50 µg per mL).  Cells are susceptible to lysis by 0.1% (w/v) SDS and hypotonic solutions.  The G+C content of genomic DNA is 33.5% (HPLC).  The type strain, IH1T (=JCM 11175T=DSM 14208T), was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent chimney at the Iheya Ridge, in the Okinawa Trough, Japan</description>
