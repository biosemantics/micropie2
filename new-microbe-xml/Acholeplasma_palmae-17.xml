  <description>Acholeplasma palmae sp. nov. Acholeplasma palmae (pal’mae. L. fem. gen. n. palmae, of a palm tree, referring to the plant from which the organism was isolated) Cells are primarily coccoid, ranging in diameter from 300 to 500 nm. Cells lack true cell walls. Nonmotile. Colonies on solid medium containing 0.8% Noble agar usually have the appearance of fried eggs. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Does not hydrolyze arbutin, arginine, or urea. Agar colonies do not hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Cholesterol or serum is not required for growth. The temperature range for growth is 18 to 37°C; optimum temperature is 30°C. Serologically distinct from other Acholeplasma species. Isolated from the crown tissues of a palm (Cocos nucifera) tree with lethal yellowing disease in Jamaica. Apparently not pathogenic for some leafhoppers; plant pathogenicity has not been determined. The average genome size is 1,610 kbp.  The G+C content of the DNA is 30.0 mol%, as determined by buoyant density, melting temperature, and HPLC methods. The type strain is 5233 (= ATCC 49389).</description>
