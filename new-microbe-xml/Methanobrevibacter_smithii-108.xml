  <description>Cells are short oval rods or coccobacilli with tapered ends, 0.6-0.7 µm in width and ~1.0 µm in length.  Gram positive.  Nonmotile.  One or more B vitamins are required for stimulatory to growth, and acetate is required as a major cource of cell carbon.  Nickel is required for growth.  NH4+ is the sole source of cell nitrogen, and H2S may serve as the sole source of cell sulfur.  H2 and CO2 are the preferred energy sources.  Growth on formate is poor.  Cell extracts do not have CO dehydrogenase activity.  An F420-dependent formate dehydrogenase oxidizes formate to CO and reduced F420.  Incorporates acetate and CO2 into cell carbon by reductive carboxylation of acetate to form pyruvate.  Isolated from an anaerobic sewage sludge enrichment with formate as the exogenously added energy source.  Is the dominant methanogen in human feces who harbor methanogens in their large bowels.  The range of mol% G+C is 28.8-29.5 (Tm).  Optimal temperature 37-40˚C.  Temperature range 30-45˚C.  Energy for growth is obtained by reduction of CO2 to CH4 by using H2 and sometimes formate as the electron donor.  Acetate, methanol, methylamines, or other organic compounds are not used as electron donors for CH4 formation.  NH4+ is a major course of cell nitrogen.</description>
