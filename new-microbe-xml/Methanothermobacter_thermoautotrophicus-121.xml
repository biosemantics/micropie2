  <description>Cells are slender, cylindrical, irregularly crooked rods, 0.35-0.6 µm in diameter and 3-7 µm in length.  Frequent filaments of 10-120 µm long.  Habitat: thermophilic, anaerobic, sewage sludge digestors.  Cells Gram-positive.  Nonmotile.  Cells produce fimbriae.  Strictly anaerobic.  Fastest growth between 55˚C and 65˚C.  Energy metabolism by the reduction of CO2 to CH4, with H2 as the electron donor.  Formate is not used as a substrate for methanogenesis.  Capable of growth between pH 7-8.  Sulfur is reduced to sulfide.  Ammonia is the sole nitrogen source, and sulfide may serve as the sulfur source.  The mol% G+C is 49 (Tm).</description>
