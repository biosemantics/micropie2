  <description>Spiroplasma velocicrescens sp. nov. Spiroplasma velocicrescens (ve.lo.ci. cres'cens. L. adj. veloci, fast; L. part. crescens, growing; M. L. n. part. velocicrescens, fast growing). Cells are helical, motile filaments, vary from 200 to 300 nm in diameter, and lack cell walls. Colonies on solid medium containing 0.8% Noble agar are diffuse and never have a fried egg appearance. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Hydrolyzes arginine. Does not hydrolyze urea. Film and spot reaction negative. Does not hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Cholesterol or serum is required for growth. The temperature range for growth is 10 to 41°C; the doubling time at 37°C, the optimum temperature, is 0.6 h. Serologically distinct from previously described Spiroplasma species. Isolated from the gut of the vespid wasp M. quadridens. Pathogenicity for insects has not been determined. The G+C content of the DNA is 27.5 +/- 1 mol%. The genome size is 1,480 kbp (940 MDa). The type strain is MQ-4 (= ATCC 35262).</description>
