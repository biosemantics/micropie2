  <description>Spiroplasma montanense sp. nov. Spiroplasma montanense (mon.ta.nen'se. M.L. adj. montanense, pertaining to Montana, where the species was first isolated). Cells are helical, motile filaments that lack a cell wall. Colonies on solid medium containing 2.25% Noble agar are granular and have dense centers, irregular margins, and numerous small satellites. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Hydrolyzes arginine but not urea. Cholesterol or serum is not required for growth. The temperature range for growth is 5 to 41°C, and optimum growth occurs at 32°C; at 32°C the doubling time is 0.7 h. Serologically distinct from previously established Spiroplasma species, groups, and subgroups. Isolated from the gut of the tabanid fly H. opaca. Pathogenicity for insects has not been determined. The G+C content of the DNA is 28 +/- 1 mol%, as determined by the buoyant density method. The genome size is approximately 1,225 kbp. The type strain is HYOS-1 (= ATCC 51745).</description>
