  <description>Cells exhibit a tumbling motility by means of tufts of flagella.  They are cocci (diameter 1-3 µm) and occur singly and in pairs.  Pale yellow colonies about 1 mm in diameter formed on Phytagel plates.  Growth occurs between 55 and 91 ˚C, with an optimum around 85 ˚C (doubling time 35-40 min).  Growth occurs between pH 5.25 and 7 with an optimum of approximately pH 6.5, and with sea salt concentrations between 12.5 and 56.25 g per liter with an optimum of approximately 25 g per liter.  Obligately anaerobic.  Chemolithotrophic.  Uses H2 and CO2 as energy and carbon sources to produce methane.  No growth was observed on acetate, formate, methanol, monomethylamine, or yeast extract.  Growth is stimulated by selenate, tungstate and yeast extract.  Sulphur is reduced to hydrogen sulphide in the presence of CO2 and H2.  Growth is inhibited by chloramphenicol (75 µg per ml) and rifampicin (50 µg per ml) but not by streptomycin, penicillin G, kanamycin and ampicillin (all at 200 µg per ml).  DNA base composition of the type strain is 33 mol% G+C (as determined by the thermal denaturation method).  The type strain is Methanococcus infernus MET, which was obtained from a deepsea hydrothermal vent chimney at Mid-Atlantic Ridge (14˚ 45’N).  Strain MET has been deposited in the DSMZ-Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismenund Zellkulturen under accession number DSM 11812T.</description>
