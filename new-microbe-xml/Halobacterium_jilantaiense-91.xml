  <description>Cells are slender rods (0.5–1.0 x 1.0–3.0 µm) and Gram-negative.  Colonies on agar plates containing 25% (w/v) total salts are red, elevated and round.  Growth is chemoorganotrophic and aerobic; it occurs at 2.7–5.2 M NaCl and 0.05–0.3 M Mg2+ at pH 5.5–8.5 and at 22–55 ˚C.  Optimal NaCl concentration, Mg2+ concentration, pH and temperature for growth are 3.1–3.5 M, 0.1–0.2 M, pH 7.0–7.5 and 40 ˚C, respectively.  Catalase- and oxidase-positive.  Grows anaerobically in the presence of L-arginine, nitrate and DMSO.  Nitrate reduction to nitrite is observed and H2S is produced from cysteine.  Indole formation is positive.  Tween 80 and starch are not hydrolysed.  Casein and gelatin are hydrolysed.  Amino acids are required for growth.  Starch is not hydrolysed.  Glucose, galactose, sucrose, maltose, fructose, sorbose, xylose, mannose, lactose, D-ribose, mannitol and sorbitol are not utilized.  Glycerol is utilized without acid production.  Susceptible to anisomycin and novobiocin.  Resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, rifampicin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, bacitracin and erythromycin.  Cells contain C20C20 derivatives of PG, PGP-Me, PGS, S-TGD-1, S-TeGD and TGD-1.  The DNA G+C content is 64.2 mol%.  The type strain, NG4T (=CGMCC 1.5337T=JCM13558T), was isolated from Jilantai salt lake in Inner Mongolia, China.</description>
