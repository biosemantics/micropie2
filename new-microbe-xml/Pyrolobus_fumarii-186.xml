  <description>Cells regularly to irregularly lobed cocci, about 0.7 to 2.5 µm in diameter.  White colonies, about 1 mm in diameter, formed on plates solidified by Gelrite.  Growth between 90°C and 113°C (optimum 106°C), at pH 4.0–6.5 (optimum pH 5.5), and at 1%–4% NaCl (optimum: 1.7%).  Pressure of 25 MPa tolerated.  Exponential cultures survive a 1-hour autoclaving at 121°C.  Optimal doubling time, 60 min.  Strictly chemolithoautotrophic growth by anaerobic and microaerophilic H2 oxidation, with NO3-, S2O32-, and O2 as electron acceptors.  NO3- is reduced to ammonia.  No stimulation of growth by organic compounds.  Growth inhibition by acetate, pyruvate, glucose, starch, or elemental sulfur.  Cell envelope composed of a protein surface layer, exhibiting p4 symmetry and a center-to-center spacing of neighboring protein complexes of 18.5 nm.  Core lipids mainly glycerol-dialkyl-glycerol-tetraether.  Non-hydrolyzed lipids contain a main spot on TLC staining blue (instead of violet) by anisaldehyde.  DNA base composition is 53 mol% GC.  Type strain: Pyrolobus fumarii 1A, DSM 11204, Braunschweig, Germany (isolated from a black smoker wall, TAG site, Mid Atlantic Ridge).  In the presence of H2 (and nitrate or thiosulfate), supplementation with yeast extract, meat extract, peptone, tryptone, casein, gelatine, casamino acids, raffinose, or formate did not influence growth, while acetate, citrate, pyruvate, glucose, or starch strongly inhibited or even prevented growth (at 0.1% w/v).  In the absence of H2, with the same organic substances, no growth was observed.</description>
