  <description>Mycoplasma pirum sp. nov. Mycoplasma pirum (pir’um. L. neut. n. pirum pear, referring to the pear-shaped morphology of the cells). Cells are predominantly flask or pear shaped and possess an organized terminal structure. An outer, finely particulate nap (about 3 nm thick) covers the entire surface of the cell. Growth occurs in most conventional mycoplasma media. Colonies on solid medium under anaerobic conditions have a classic fried-egg appearance. The optimum temperature for growth appears to be 37°C. The organisms produce acid from glucose and can also hydrolyze arginine. Urea is not hydrolyzed. Phosphatase, film and spot reaction, and gel liquefaction tests are negative. No hemadsorption of guinea pig erythrocytes occurs. Serologically distinct from previously established Mycoplasma species, as determined by growth inhibition and plate immunofluorescence tests. Pathogenicity unknown. Not cytopathogenic for cell cultures.  The habitat is not currently known. All strains of the organism have come from cell cultures. The G+C content of the DNA is 25.5 mol%, as determined by the buoyant density method. Type strain: strain HRC 70-159 (= ATCC 25960).</description>
