  <description>Cyanobacteria, produces irregular, packet-like (sarcinoid) colonies that form black mats, films and crusts. Blackish color due to presence of UV screening compound for high solar exposure. Colonies are granular and commonly subaerophytic. Isolated from Punta Cierva (Anarctic Peninsula) and King George Island ( South Shetland Islands) between 1998 to 2003 from coastal, deglaciated areas of the maritime Antarctic from snowmelt irrigated rock and other aquatic and semi-aquatic environments including soil, stones, rocks and water biotopes. Grows during the Antarctic midsummer season. Sheaths are sharply delimited, partly colorless in younger colonies, and later become slightly lamellated and gold yellow, rusty yellow-brown to orange. Cells spherical, irregular-spherical to semi-globose with slightly granulated content. Contents inside cells a pale blue-green or grayish color. Cells 4-9µm in diameter, divide irregularly. Reproduction by disintegration of colonies, sometimes solitary cells liberated from sheaths. Single pale blue-green cells without sheaths can occur in young colonies and later in well developed colonies. Grows at a wide range of pH, conductivity and nutrient concentrations, and is well adapted to the varying chemical characteristics of meltwaters from various surrounding habitats. Important role as a pioneer oxyphototroph on stones and rocks, and surrvives desiccation and freezing during winter. Attempts at culture have not been successful, although it is a common species.</description>
