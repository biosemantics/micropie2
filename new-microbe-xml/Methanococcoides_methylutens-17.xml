  <description>Morphology and colony characteristics are the same as those described for the genus: temperature optimum 30 to 35Â°C; pH optimum 7.0 to 7.5; source anaerobic sediments from the Sumner branch of Scripps Canyon located near La Jolla, Calif.; physiology, fastidious anaerobe.  TMA, methylamine, and methanol serve as substrates for growth and methanogenesis; H2-CO2, formate, and acetate do not; nutrition, optimal growth at 0.44 M NaCl and 25 mM or greater MgSO4; yeast extract, Trypticase, rumen fluid, or B vitamins stimulate growth; type strain, TMA-10. This strain has been deposited in the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md., as number 33938.</description>
