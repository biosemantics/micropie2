  <description>Cells are rod-shaped 1.5-6 µm by 0-7-1.0 µm but become pleomorphic in unfavourable conditions.  Requires at least 1.7 M NaCl for growth and cells lyse in less than 1-5 M NaCl.  Optimum NaCl concentration for growth 3.4-4.3 M.  Cells contain only low levels of carotenoids and hence colonies are pale orange, beige or almost colourless.  Colonies are circular, entire, convex, translucent, 1-2 mm in diameter.  Isolated from salted fish and hides.  Chemoorganotrophic and strictly aerobic.  Nitrogen sources: Casamino acids.  Carbon sources: Casamino acids, glucose, fructose, lactose but not ribose.  Reduces nitrates to nitrites and nitrites to an unknown end product.  Liquefies gelatin, does not produce sulphide from cysteine, indole or amylase.  Possesses C20C20 and C20C25 diether core lipids and menaquinones MK-8 and MK-8(H2).  Possesses phospholipids: phosphatidyl glycerol, phosphatidy1 glycerol methylphosphate, significant amounts of phosphatidyl glycerosulphate and several unidentified glycolipids.  Grows in pH range 6.0-8.4, optimum 7.2-7.6.  Temperature optimum 37-40 ˚C.  Sensitive to anisomycin, bacitracin, novobiocin, vibriostatic agent (0/129) and sulphamethoxazole/ trimethoprim.  Slightly sensitive to rifampicin.  Insensitive to amphotericin B, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, flavomycin, streptomycin and tetracycline.  Possesses a large plasmid of about 144kbp.  Type strain: NCIMB 777. Strain NCIMB 784, deposited as Halobacterium trapanicum by Formisano (1962) is regarded as synonymous with NCIMB 777.</description>
