  <description>Spiroplasma syrphidicola sp. nov. Spiroplasma syrphidicola (syr.phi.di'co.la. M. L. pl. n. Syrphidae, a family of flies [nomenclatural name]; L. n. cola, dweller, inhabitant; M. L,. m. n. Syrphidicola, inhabitant of syrphid flies, the insects from which the organism was isolated). Cells are helical, motile filaments that lack a cell wall. Colonies on solid medium containing 2.25% Noble agar are irregular with satellites and diffuse and never have a fried-egg appearance. Growth on solid medium containing 1.6% Noble agar is diffuse. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Hydrolyzes arginine but not urea. Cholesterol or serum is required for growth. The temperature range for growth is 10 to 41Â°C. Optimum growth occurs at 32"C, with a doubling time of 1.0 h. Serologically distinct from previously described Spiroplasma species and putative groups. Isolated from the hemolymph of the syrphid fly E. arbustorum. Pathogenicity for insects has not been determined.  The G+C content of the DNA is 30 +/- 1 mol%, as determined by the buoyant density method. The genome size is approximately 1,230 kbp. The type strain is strain EA-1 (= ATCC 33826).</description>
