  <description>Anaeroplasma intermedium sp. nov. Anaeroplasma intermedium sp. nov. (in.ter.meâ€™di.um. L. neut. adj. intermedium intermediate). Strains 7LA, 5LA, and 5LB, hitherto regarded as members of A. bactoclasticum serovar 2, are transferred to this species. Strain 7LA (ATCC 43166) is designated as the type strain. Cultural, nutritional, and physiological characteristics are essentially as reported for A. bactoclasticum. Serologically distinct from other species of the genus by agglutination, metabolism inhibition, and agar gel immunodiffusion precipitation tests. The G+C content of strain 7LA is 32.5 mol% (Bd). DNA-DNA homologies between strain 7LA and the type strains of A. bactoclasticum and A. abactoclasticum are less than 5%, as in contrast with values of about 80% intraspecific homology.</description>
