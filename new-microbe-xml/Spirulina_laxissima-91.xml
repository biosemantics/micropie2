  <description>tightly coiled trichomes, halotolerant, Cyanobacteria with tightly coiled trichomes are frequently found in thermal freshwater environments as well as in brackish, marine and hypersaline waters, Under favourable conditions they can form dense benthic populations and make major contributions to primary productivity., they are traditionally considered cosmopolitan micro-organisms with remarkable capabilities to acclimatize to broad ranges of environmental conditions, euryhaline cyanobacteria, from hypersaline waters, are constricted at the easily discernable crosswalls. They are curved or loosely helical, but spirality is not regular; it has longer relative wavelength than in any of the other strains (Fig. 1). Motility was not observed. This strain differed from all other strains investigated in this study by maintaining buoyancy and growing suspended homogeneously in liquid medium, instead of adhering to glass walls of culture tubes or forming pellicles., contained phycocyanin,</description>
