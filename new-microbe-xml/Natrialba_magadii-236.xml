  <reference>Bergey’s Manual pg 326-7</reference>
  <file>Colonies are 2-3 mm in diameter after 5-7 d at 37˚C, wrinkled, friable, and orange-red.  In liquid culture, cells are short rods 0.7-0.9 x 2-4 µm.  Motile by tuft of polar flagella.  Growth occurs in media containing 2-5.2 M NaCl with an optimum at 3.5 M.  Growth occurs at 20-50˚C; optimum temperature 37-40˚C.  Alkaliphilic with growth requirement for sodium carbonate.  The pH range for growth, 8.5-11; optimum 9.5.  Sugars not utilized, although acetate stimulates growth.  Gelatin is liquefied; sulfide is produced from thiosulfate.  Does not hydrolyze starch.  A large 144 kb plasmid is present.  The mol% G+C of the DNA is 63.0 (major component) and 49.5 (minor component).   Strictly aerobic.  Oxidase and catalase positive.  Isolated from hypersaline habitats.  All strains posses C20C20 and C20C25 core diether lipids, presented as double spots of PG and PGP-Me.  No glycolipid has been detected.  Gram negative.  Amino acids are required for growth.</file>
