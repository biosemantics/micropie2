  <description>Irregular cocci; cell width 1.3 µm.  Cells are peritrichously flagellated.  Gram-negative; sensitive to 1% SDS.  Cell wall has a periodic surface pattern.  Colony characteristics: Circular, convex, yellow with entire edges and a shiny surface.  DNA base composition: 61 mol % G + C.  Temperature optimum 20- 25˚C.  pH optimum 6.2 to 6.6.  Isolated from sediment from the Black Sea.  Fastidious anaerobe; formate or H2-CO2 serve as substrates for growth and methane production; acetate and methanol do not. Optimal growth at 0.19M Na+; Trypticase required for growth.  Type strain: JR1.  DSM number 1498 Gottingen, FRG.  The description of the type strain is the same as for the species.</description>
