  <description>Entomoplasma melaleucae sp. nov. Entomoplasma melaleucae (mel.a’leu.cae. N. L. n. Melaleuca, a genus of tropical trees having white flowers with sweet fragrance; N. L. fem. n. melaleucae, of Melaleuca, the plant from which strain MIT was first isolated). Cells are nonhelical, pleomorphic, and coccoidal or subcoccoidal, with few filamentous forms, and lack a true cell wall. Coccoidal forms average 250 to 300 nm in diameter. Nonmotile. Colonies on agar medium under optimum atmospheric conditions display a fried egg appearance. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose and fructose. Negative for sucrose, lactose, trehalose, and mannose. Does not hydrolyze arginine or urea. Film and spot reaction negative. Does not hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Cholesterol or serum is required for growth. The temperature range for growth is 10 to 32°C; optimum growth occurs at 23 to 30°C. Serologically distinct from other Mycoplasma species. Isolated from the flower surface of a tropical plant, Melaleuca quinquenervia, in south Florida. Related strains have been isolated from flowers of Melaleuca decora and Grevillea robusta (silk oak) and from an anthophorine bee (X. micans). Average genome size, 576 megadaltons. The base composition (G+C content) of the DNA is 27.0 +/- 1 mol% (buoyant density method). The type strain is strain M1 (= ATCC 49191).</description>
