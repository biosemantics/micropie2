  <description>Small, irregular coccoid cells usually occurring singly, &lt; 1 µm in diameter.  Flagellated and weakly motile.  Gram negative.  Cell envelope consists of a hexagonally arranged S-layer with a center-to-center spacing of the subunits of 15.8 nm.  Glycoprotein subunits with an apparent molecular weight of Mr 92000 are found.  Obligately anaerobic and chemoorganotrophic.  Methane is produced from H2/CO2 and formate.  No growth or methane production from acetate, methylamines, methanol, ethanol, l-propanol, 2-propanol/CO2, 1-butanol, 2-butanol/CO2 and cyclohexanol.  The optimal growth temperature is 30˚C.  No growth observed at or below 15˚C and at or above 45˚C.  Optimal pH 7.0.  No dependence of growth on NaCl.  Growth factors present in clarified rumen fluid are required for growth.  G+C content of the DNA is 52.0 mo1% (Tm) and 50.0 mol% (HPLC).</description>
