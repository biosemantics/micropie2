  <description>Cells are motile, rod-shaped (0.9–1.2 x 1.8–5.5 µm) and Gram-negative.  Colonies on agar plates containing 2.6 M NaCl are red, elevated and round.  Chemo-organotrophic and aerobic.  Growth occurs at NaCl concentrations of 1.7–4.8 M, at pH 7.0–9.0 and temperatures of 25–58 ˚C.  Optimal NaCl concentration, pH and temperature for growth are 2.6 M, pH 7.5 and 45–48 ˚C, respectively.  Catalase- and oxidase-positive.  Anaerobic growth with nitrate, arginine or DMSO does not occur.  Nitrate reduction to nitrite is observed.  H2S is not produced from Na2S2O3.  Negative for indole formation.  Tweens 20, 40, 60 and 80 are hydrolysed.  Caseinase-negative.  Amylase- and gelatinase positive.  Glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose, sucrose and maltose are utilized and acids are produced.  No growth or acid production is observed on sorbose, xylose, lactose, D-ribose, mannitol or sorbitol.  Sensitive to rifampicin, bacitracin and novobiocin.  Resistant to erythromycin, neomycin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, penicillin G, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, kanamycin, tetracycline and vancomycin.  Cells contain C20–C20 derivatives of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate methyl ester, phosphatidylglycerol sulfate and sulfated mannosyl-glucosyl glycerol diether.  The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 65.9 mol% (Tm).  The type strain, 9-3T (=CGMCC 1.5332T=JCM 13559T), was isolated from Aibi salt lake in Xin-Jiang, China.</description>
