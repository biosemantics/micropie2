  <description>Cells are irregular coccoids, 1.0–2.0 µm in diameter.  Cells are lysed by detergents.  Gram-negative.  Non-motile.  Cells grow by forming methane from methanol, monomethylamine, dimethylamine, or trimethylamine.  Cells are unable to grow with H2/CO2, acetate, formate, or dimethylsulfide.  The maximum rate of growth is between 40–50 ˚C, 0.2–0.6 M NaCl, 100–200 mM MgCl2 and pH 7.0–8.0.  No organic compounds are required for growth.  The type strain, SD1T (=ATCC BAA-1601T=DSM 21339T), was isolated from a coal seam near Monroe, LA, USA.  The G+C content of the genomic DNA of the type strain is 42±1 mol%.</description>
