  <description>Slightly irregular cells, 0.8 -2.5 µm in width, monopolar polytrichous flagellated.  Growth between 70 and 103˚C, pH 5-9 and 0.5-5% NaCl.  Optimal growth occurred at 100˚C, pH 7, and 2% NaCl.  Shortest doubling time about 37 min under optimal conditions.  Strictly anaerobic.  Heterotrophic growth on peptone, tryptone, yeast extract, meat extract, extracts of bacterial and archaebacterial cells, casein, maltose, starch and casamino acids.  Formation of H2 and CO2 from yeast extract and peptone.  Sulfur is only required for growth at high hydrogen concentrations.  In the presence of sulfur, H2S is formed in addition.  Cells Gram-negative.  No murein present.  Cell envelope contains periodate- Schiff-positive polypeptides.  ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 by diphtheria toxin.  Isopranyl ether lipids in the cell membrane.  38 mol% GC.  Occurs in marine hot biotopes.  Type strain is Pyrococcus furiosus, Vc 1, DSM 3638, Gottingen, FRG.  Isolated from beach locations of Porto di Vevante, Vulcano Island, Italy.  No growth on alcohols, organic acids, amino acids, and on most of the carbohydrates.  No growth on glucose, galactose, sorbose, ribose, arabinose, xylose, sucrose, lactose, raffinose, mannitol, xylitol, gluconate, DL-alanine, L-cysteine, methanol, ethanol, glycerol, formate, acetate, malate, citrate, L-(+)-lactate and a mixture of isovalerate and iso- and methyl-butyrate.</description>
