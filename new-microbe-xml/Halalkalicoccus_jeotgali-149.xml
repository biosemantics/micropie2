  <description>Cells are non-motile cocci with a diameter of 1–1.5 µm and Gram-variable, growing aggregately.  Colonies are red and round with a diameter of 0.5–1.0 mm after incubation for 5 days on the medium, mentioned above, at 37 ˚C.  Cell lysis does not occur in distilled water.  Growth occurs in 10–30% (w/v) NaCl, at temperatures ranging from 21 to 50 ˚C and at pH values ranging from 6.5 to 9.0.  Optimal conditions are temperatures ranging from 37 to 45 ˚C, a pH of 7.0 and NaCl concentration of 15%.  The isolate is catalase-positive, oxidase-negative and does not reduce nitrate to nitrite.  Glucose, sucrose, citrate, lactose and acetate can be utilized as sole carbon and energy sources.  The polar lipid fraction consists of PG and PGP-Me.  PGS and glycolipids were absent.  The strain is resistant to the following antibiotics (µg per mL): bacitracin (50), penicillin (50), ampicillin (50), chloramphenicol (50) and erythromycin (50) and is sensitive to the following antibiotics (µg per mL): novobiocin (25), anisomycin (25) and aphidicolin (25).  The DNA G+C content of strain B3T is 63.2 mol%.  The type strain, B3T (=KCTC 4019T=DSM 18796T=JCM 14584T=CECT 7217T), was isolated from shrimp jeotgal, a traditional Korean fermented seafood.  Fructose not utilized.</description>
