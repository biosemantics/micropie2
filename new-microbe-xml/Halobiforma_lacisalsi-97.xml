  <description>Cells are motile, Gram-negative and pleomorphic (rods and coccoid forms).  Rods lyse in distilled water.  Colonies are reddish, smooth, circular and elevated.  Growth requires at least 1.7 M NaCl, optimally 2.6–4.3 M NaCl.  Growth occurs at 0–0.5 M MgCl2, optimally at around 0–0.2 M MgCl2.  The pH range for growth is 6.5–9.0, with an optimum at pH 7.5.  The temperature range for growth is between 24 and 57 ˚C, with an optimum at 42–45 ˚C.  Chemo-organotrophic.  Anaerobic growth occurs in the presence of nitrate.  Oxidase- and catalase-positive.  Nitrate is reduced and gas is produced.  Nitrite is not reduced.  Negative for indole formation.  Gelatin and Tween 80 are hydrolysed, whereas starch and casein are not.  H2S is produced from thiosulfate.  The following substrates are utilized for growth: fructose, glucose, glycerol, glutamate, arginine, lysine, ornithine, acetate, pyruvate and lactate.  Mannose, starch, arabinose, lactose, mannitol, rhamnose, sorbitol, maltose, galactose, D-ribose, sucrose, D-xylose, aspartate, glycine, alanine, fumarate, malate, propionate, succinate and citrate are not utilized for growth.  Acid is produced from glucose and glycerol.  Sensitive to tetracycline and vancomycin, but not to norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, kanamycin or ampicillin.  The major polar lipids are C20C20 and C20C25 derivatives of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol phosphatemethyl ester and glycolipid.  The G+C content of the DNA is 64.9 mol% (Tm).  The type strain, strain AJ5T (=CGMCC 1.3738T=JCM 12983T), was isolated from a salt lake in Altun Mountain in China.</description>
