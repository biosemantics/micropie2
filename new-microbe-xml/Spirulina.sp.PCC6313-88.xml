  <description>Cyanobacteria with tightly coiled trichomes are frequently found in thermal freshwater environments as well as in brackish, marine and hypersaline waters, Under favourable conditions they can form dense benthic populations and make major contributions to primary productivity, On the basis of the tightness of the helix, thin cross-walls (invisible by light microscopy) and several ultrastructural features, they are morphologically distinguished from a variety of other cyanobacteria with more loosely helical or sinuous trichomes, Marine strains were somewhat variable with respect to salinity optima and tolerances. Typically they grew with optimum rates at 3Â±2%total salts (MPI S1, PCC 6313, 7%)., Strains PCC 6313 and UBMM Hi 45 were remarkable in that they did not show a distinct and narrow salinity optimum, but were able to grow with close to optimum rates in freshwater medium (BG11). Thus, they can be termed euryhaline. contained phycocyanin, The carotenoid composition in the freshwater strain CCC Snake P. Y-85 and in the marine strains PCC 6313 and MPI S1 was found to be very similar., Strains PCC 6313 and UBMM Hi 45 have openly coiled trichomes and thus are morphologically similar to each other and distinct from all other strains.,</description>
