  <description>Mycoplasma phocidae sp. nov. Mycoplasma phocidae (pho’cid.ae. L. n.phoca, seal;phocidae, of a seal). Thin sections reveal mainly coccoid forms with a clearly defined three-layer membrane and no cell wall. Colonies on agar have a typical fried egg appearance. The organism grows at 37°C microaerophilically or anaerobically. Cells pass through filters having pore diameters of 450 nm but are retained by filters having pore diameters of 220 nm. The organism is resistant to penicillin and thallium acetate, and there is no reversion to bacterial forms in medium that lacks these substances. Cultures are inhibited by digitonin and require serum for growth. Arginine is hydrolyzed, but glucose and urea are not. Film and spots are produced on horse serum agar. Phosphatase is produced. Tetrazolium is not reduced. Serum and casein are not digested. Alpha-hemolysis occurs on bovine blood agar. The organism hemagglutinates but does not hemadsorb on sheep, guinea pig, chicken, or seal erythrocytes. The G+C content of the DNA is 27.8 mol%. The species is serologically distinct from other Mycoplasma species. The habitat is the respiratory tracts of harbor seals. The organism appeared to be avirulent following experimental inoculation of grey or harp seals, but it may contribute to respiratory disease of harbor seals in association with other infections or environmental factors. The type strain is strain 105 (= ATCC 33657).</description>
