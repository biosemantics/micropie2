  <description>Strictly anaerobic, mesophilic, neutrophilic or mildly alkaliphilic.  Cells are Gram-stain-negative, non-sporulating and motile by polar, tufted flagella.  Cells form curved or wavy rods with blunt ends.  Produce methane from H2 or formate.  The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 45– 49.5 mol%.  Represent a distinct phylogenetic lineage in the family Methanospirillaceae based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis.  The following properties are additional to those given for the genus.  Cells are 0.4–0.5 µm wide by 7.4–10 µm in length, and often form wavy filaments from 15 µm to several hundred micrometres long.  Growth occurs at 20–50 ˚C, with optimum growth at 37–45 ˚C.  The pH range for growth is 6.5–10.0, with optimum growth at pH 7.0–9.0.  Growth occurs below 1% NaCl (w/v), with optimum growth in basal medium without the addition of NaCl.  Methane is produced from H2 and formate, but not from acetate, pyruvate, methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1- butanol, 2-butanol or trimethylamine.  Acetate or yeast extract is required for growth.  The G+C content of the genomic DNA of the type strain is 45–49.5 mol%.  The type strain, JF-1T (=NBRC 100397T), was isolated from sewage sludge.</description>
