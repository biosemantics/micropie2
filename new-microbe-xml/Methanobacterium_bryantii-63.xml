  <reference>Replacement of the Type Strain of Methanobacterium formicicum and Reinstatement of Methanobacterium bryantii sp. nov. nom. rev. (ex Balch and Wolfe, 1981) with M.o.H. (DSM 863) as the Type Strain IJSB 37:172-173</reference>

  <description>Cells are slender and cylindrical with blunt, rounded ends, often forming chains and filaments which are irregularly crooked.  Cells are 0.5 to 1.0 µm wide, and chains and filaments are 10 to 15 µm long.  Gram stain results are variable.  Nonmotile.  Fimbriae are present.  Surface colonies, which can reach 1 to 5 mm in diameter, are flat with diffuse to filamentous edges and have a characteristic gray to light gray-green appearance.  Deep colonies are rounded and filamentous.  Cells tend to clump in liquid culture.  Ammonia is used as a nitrogen source.  Acetate, cysteine, and B vitamins are highly stimulatory for growth.  Unable to catabolize formate.  Good growth at 37 and 45°C but not at 55°C.  Mol% G + C of the DNA is 33 to 38 (determined by buoyant density).  Type strain: M.0.H. (DSM 863) was isolated from the coculture “Methanobacillus omelianskii,’ ’ which was originally isolated from an anaerobic digestor.  Reference strain: M.0.H.G. (DSM 862).</description>
