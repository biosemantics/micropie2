  <reference>Phylogenetic analysis of 18 thermophilic Methanobacterium isolates supports the proposals to create a new genus, Methanothermobacter gen. nov., and to reclassify several isolates in three species, Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus comb. nov., Methanothermobacter wolfeii comb. nov., and Methanothermobacter marburgensis sp. nov.

  <description>Cells are slender, cylindrical, sometimes crooked rods that are 0.35-0.5 µm wide and 2.5 µm long and occur singly or in pairs, or in longer chains.  Gram-positive.  Non-motile.  Endospores not formed.  Colonies on agar plates are 1.2 mm in diameter, yellowish and convex.  Growth is rapid in mineral medium with NH3 as the sole nitrogen source, sulfide as the sole sulfur source and H2/CO2 or formate as the sole carbon and energy sources.  The type strain is stimulated by addition of tungsten and spontaneously lyses when deprived of energy.  The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 61 mol% as determined by thermal denaturation.  Strains are devoid of extrachromosomal elements.  The type strain harbours a chromosomally integrated, defective prophage.  Habitat: mesophilic and thermophilic sludge or digesters. Temperature range is 37-74˚C, optimum 55-65˚C.  pH range is 6.0-8.2, optimum 7.0-7.5.  NaCl optimum 0-10 g NaCl per liter.  Habitat: mesophilic sewage sludge and hot springs.  The type strain is strain DSM 2970T (=ATCC 43096T), which was isolated from a mixture of sewage sludge and river sediment.</description>
