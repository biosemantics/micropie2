  <description>Mycoplasma yeatsii sp. nov. Mycoplasma yeatsii (yeatâ€™sii M. L. gen. n. yeatsii, of Yeats, named after F. R. Yeats, one of the original coisolators of the organism). M. yeatsii is serologically distinct from all of the other Acholeplasma, Entomoplasma, Mesoplasma, and Mycoplasma species evaluated in this study. Colonies on agar have the fried-egg appearance characteristic of most mycoplasmas. M. yeatsii utilizes glucose and mannose slowly, requiring 2 weeks or longer for a decrease in pH of 0.5 or more units. Sterol is required for growth. Arginine is hydrolyzed, and tetrazolium is reduced aerobically. Phosphatase is not produced, and urea is not hydrolyzed. Serum and casein are not digested, and film and spots are not produced on equine or porcine serum-containing media. Guinea pig erythrocytes are hemadsorbed, but chicken erythrocytes are not hemadsorbed. Good growth occurs aerobically, but only sparse growth occurs under anaerobic (GasPak) conditions.  Colonies on ovine blood agar that are incubated aerobically produce a zone of viridans type hemolysis, which changes to weak betahemolysis after further incubation, Filterable through 220-nm-pore-size filters with some loss of viability. The G+C content of the DNA is 26.6 mol%. The type strain is GIH (= ATCC 51346 = NCTC 11730). Many other serologically similar isolates have been identified in Australia and in the United States. The usual habitat is the external ear canals of goats, but strain GIH serotypes have also been isolated from a retropharyngeal lymph node and from nasal tracts, internal organs, and milk of naturally infected goats.</description>
