  <description>thermophilic cyanobacteria, Cyanobacteria are oxygenic, photoautotrophic prokaryotes which possess two photosystems (PSI and PSII) releasing electrons from water and which Â®x carbon dioxide via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham pathway. The fixed carbon is partially deposited in the form of intracellular polymers such as glycogen, other polyglucans and cyanophycin, which serve as carbon and energy reserves., heterocystous branching filamentous strain, active PHA accumulating strains (Table 3) and must obviously possess thermotolerant PHA synthases, which have been so far unavailable and which are of interest for various biotechnological applications</description>
