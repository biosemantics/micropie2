  <description>Cells are lysed in distilled water.  Colonies are pigmented beige–orange and are circular, convex, translucent, entire and smooth.  Growth occurs in the range of 2.5 to 5.2 M NaCl with an optimum at 3.5 M.  Growth occurs in a concentration of 1 M Mg2+ or less, with optimum growth at 0.4 M Mg2+.  The pH range for growth is 6.0–8.5, with an optimum at pH 7.0–7.5.  The temperature range for growth is 23–51 ˚C, with an optimum at 38–48 ˚C.  Chemoorganotrophic.  Aerobic.  Oxidase- and catalase-positive.  Nitrate is not reduced to nitrite.  Does not produce gas from nitrate.  Indole is produced from tryptophan and H2S is produced from sulfur and sodium thiosulfate.  Starch and Tween 80 are hydrolysed, but gelatin and casein are not hydrolysed.  Halocins are produced.  The following substrates are used as carbon sources: glucose, arabinose, galactose, fructose, rhamnose, raffinose, D-xylose, maltose, sucrose, starch, lactose, glycerol, acetate, propionate, pyruvate, L-lactate, succinate, L-malate, fumarate, citrate, L-alanine, L-ornithine.  Acid is produced from fructose and lactose.  The following substrates are not used as carbon sources: mannose, D-ribose, mannitol, sorbitol, glycine, L-arginine, L-aspartate, L-glutamate and L-lysine.  Sensitive to novobiocin, anisomycin, aphidicolin and rifampicin.  Resistant to bacitracin, erythromycin, penicillin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol and neomycin.  Lipids S-DGA-1, PGP-Me and PG are present, but phosphatidylglycerol sulfate is not present.  The G+C content of the total DNA of the type strain is 63.7 mol%.  The type strain, TL6T (=JCM 13924T=DSM 18310T), was isolated from the saline Telega Lake, Prahova county, Romania.</description>
