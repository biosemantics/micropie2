  <description>Cells are gram positive and spherical and appear as irregular aggregates which are often more than 100 µm across and which appear refractile when viewed by phase-contrast microscopy.  Colonies in agar are 1 to 3 mm in diameter and yellow and have a rough granular consistency.  Growth occurs on acetate, methanol, or methylated amines and may occur slowly on H2-CO2.  The optimum growth temperature is near 50˚C, and the optimum pH is between 6.0 and 7.0.  The only described strain requires para-aminobenzoic acid for growth.  The DNA base composition of this strain is 42 mol% guanine plus cytosine.  Source: 55°C anaerobic sludge digestor.  Type strain: strain TM-1 (= DSM 1825).</description>
