  <description>Mesoplasma coleopterae sp. nov. Mesoplasma coleopterae (co.le.op'ter.ae. M. L. fem. gen. n. coleopterae, of Coleoptera, referring to the order of insects [Coleoptera] from which the organism was first isolated). Cells are primarily coccoid, ranging in diameter from 300 to 500 nm. Cells lack true cell walls. Nonmotile. Colonies on solid medium containing 0.8% Noble agar usually have the appearance of fried eggs. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced from glucose. Does not hydrolyze arginine or urea. Agar colonies do not hemadsorb guinea pig erythrocytes. Cholesterol or serum is not required for growth, but growth in serum-free media depends on the presence of 0.04% Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan). The temperature range for growth is 10 to 37°C; optimum growth occurs at 30 to 37°C. Serologically distinct from other Mesoplasma species. Isolated from the gut of an adult soldier beetle (Chauliognathus sp.) (Coleoptera: Cantharidae) feeding on both Canada horseweed (Conyza [Erigeron] canadensis) and flowers of the vara dulce tree (Eysenhardtia texana) in Texas. Pathogenicity for plants and insects has not been determined. The average genome size is 870 kbp. The G+C content of the DNA is 27.7 mol%, as determined by Bd, T, and HPLC methods. The type strain is BARC 779 (= ATCC 49583).</description>
