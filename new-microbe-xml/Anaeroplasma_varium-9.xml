  <description>Anaeroplasma varium sp. nov. Anaeroplasma varium sp. nov. (vaâ€™ri.um. L. neut. adj. varium diverse, varied; intended to mean different from A. bactoclasticum). Strains A-2 and 10A, hitherto classified as A. bactoclasticum serovar 1, are transferred to the species. Strain A-2 (ATCC 43167) is designated as the type strain. Nutritional requirements and physiological properties are essentially as described for A. bactoclasticum. Antigenically related to the latter species as shown by double immunodiffusion precipitation tests in agar gel. The G + C content of the DNA of strain A-2 is 33.4 mol% (T,). Nucleic acid (DNA-DNA) homologies between strain A-2 and strains of A. bactoclasticum and A. abactoclasticum are about 1 and 2%, respectively (24), whereas the intraspecific percentage DNA homology is about 80%.</description>
