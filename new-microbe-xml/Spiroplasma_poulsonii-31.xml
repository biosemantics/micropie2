  <description>Spiroplasrna poulsonii (pou1.son'i.i. M.L. n. poulsonii of Poulson, named in memory of Donald F. Poulson, Professor of Biology at Yale University, in whose laboratory this spiroplasma was discovered and studied intensively). Cells are motile helical filaments 200-250 nm in diameter. The membrane-bound cells lack cell walls. Cells plated on 1-8 % Noble agar form small satellite-free colonies 60-70 um in diameter that have dense centres and uneven edges. Chemoorganotroph. Acid is produced during growth in H-2 medium. The temperature range for growth is 26-30°C, with optimum growth at 30°. The doubling time at the optimum temperature in H-2 medium is 154 h. Serologically distinct from other established Spiroplasma species. Isolated from the haemolymph of Drosophila pseudoobscura females infected by haemolymph transfer of the Barbados-3 strain of Drosophila willistoni SR organism. Pathogenicity (lethality to male progeny) confirmed by injection into Drosophila pseudoobscura.  Vertical transmissibility lost after cultivation and cloning. The G + C content of the DNA is 26 +/- 1 mol%, as determined by buoyant density and melting point methods. The genome size is 2040 kbp, as determined by PFGE. The GenBank accession number for the 16s rRNA gene sequence is M24483. The type strain is DW-I (=ATCC 43153).</description>
