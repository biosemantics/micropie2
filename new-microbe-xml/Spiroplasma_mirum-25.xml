  <description>mi'rum. L. neut. adj. mirum extraordinary. The morphology is described for the genus.  Helical filaments measure 100-200 nm in diameter and 3-8 um in length.  Colonies on solid media containing fetal bovine serum and 0.8-2.25% Noble agar (Difco) are diffuse and without central zones of growth into the agar.  Solid media prepares with 1.25% agar and in which fetal bovine serum has been replaced with bovine serum fraction yield colonies with central zones of gorwth nto the agar and no peripheral growth on the surface of the medium.  Moderate turbidity is produced during growth in liquid media.  Serologically distinct from other Spiroplasma species, groups and subgroups.  Phylogenetically, in trees constructed using 16S rRNA gene sequences, this species is basal to group I and group VIII spiroplasmas on the one hand, and to the Apis cluster and Entomoplasmataceae on the other.  It is the most primitive (plesiomorphis) spiroplasma with modal helicity.  The genome size is 1300 kbp (PFGE).   Produces experimental ocular and nervous system disease and death in intracerebrally inoculated suckling animals (rats, mice, hamsters and rabbits). Pathogenic for chicken embryos via yolk sac inoculation.  Experimentally pathogenic for the wax moth (Galleria mellonella).  Source:  the type strain was isolated from rabbit ticks (Haemaphysalis leporispalustris) collected in Georgia, USA.  Other strains have been collected in Georgia, Maryland and New York, USA.  DNA G+C content: 30-31 mol% (Tm). Type strain: ATCC 29335, SMCA. Sequence accession no. (16S rRNA gene): M24662.</description>
