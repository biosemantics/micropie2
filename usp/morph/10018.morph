filamentous
strain
,
cyanobacteria
like
tolypothrix
pcc
7601
can
adapt
the
pigment
composition
of
their
phycobilisome
to
the
prevalent
wavelengths
of
light
,
a
process
known
as
complementary
chromatic
adaptation
-lrb-
cca
-rrb-
which
allows
these
organisms
to
efficiently
utilize
the
available
light
energy
for
achieving
maximal
growth
rates
,
it
implies
de
novo
syntheses
of
molecules
that
will
form
phycobilisomes
adapted
to
the
new
light
conditions
.
