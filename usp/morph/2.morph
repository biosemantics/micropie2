the
cyanobacterium
acaryochloris
marina
was
found
to
be
the
only
oxygenic
photoautotroph
that
uses
the
pigment
chlorophyll
-lrb-
chl
-rrb-
d
as
the
predominant
photosynthetic
pigment
,
with
only
trace
amounts
of
chl
a.
although
a.
marina
produces
phycobiliproteins
-lrb-
pbps
-rrb-
,
they
do
not
form
phycobilisomes
-lrb-
pbs
-rrb-
,
a
typical
structure
for
cyanobacterial
peripheral
antenna
,
but
instead
accumulate
rod-shaped
pbp
complexes
.
