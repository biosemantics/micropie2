filamentous strain, cyanobacteria like Tolypothrix PCC 7601 can adapt the pigment composition of their phycobilisome to the prevalent wavelengths of light, a process known as complementary chromatic adaptation (CCA) which allows these organisms to efficiently utilize the available light energy for achieving maximal growth rates, It implies de novo syntheses of molecules that will form phycobilisomes adapted to the new light conditions.
