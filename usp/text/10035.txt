photosynthetic diazotrophs, these free living organisms show a significant degree of nutritional independence towards carbon and nitrogen, While UCYN-B and C are nanoplanktonic cells (2 to 10 Î¼m) closely affiliated to the cultivated strains Crocosphaera watsoniiand Cyanothece sp., respectively, In addition to being free living, UCYN have also been suggested to produce mucilage, to attach to inert particles or to live in association with planktonic eukaryotes.,These observations imply that UCYN could also contribute to nitrogen fixation of the large size fraction, thus reinforcing their role in global diazotrophic activity.
