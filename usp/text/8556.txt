In M1D medium optimal growth occurs at 30 to 37°C (doubling time, 7.2 h), and multiplication occurs at 20 to 41°C but not at 15 or 43°C. In DCCM medium, optimal growth occurs at 30°C (doubling time, 7.2 h), and multiplication occurs at 20 to 37°C.  Serologically distinct from other established and putative Spiroplasma species, groups, and subgroups.
