Lacks Thylakoids, a rod-shape unicellular cyanobacterium isolated from calcareous rock in Switzerland, obligate photoautotroph containing chlorophyll (Chl) a, carotenoids, and phycobiliproteins (phycoerythrin, phycocyanin and allophycocyanin) with a lower relative ratio of Chl a to phycobiliproteins than that of typical cyanobacteria.
