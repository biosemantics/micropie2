Optimal growth occurs with 6 g of tryptone per liter, 10 g of S˚ per liter under CO2 or N2 containing 20% (vol/vol) H2, and 17 g of NaCl per liter at pH 7 between 95 and 107°C.  The generation times are 2 to 3 h; at 85˚C, the generation time is 4.5 h.  No growth occurs at 75°C.  Slow growth occurs at 108°C.  Cells contain DNA-dependent RNA polymerase which is not sensitive to rifampin and is stable at 102°C.  The component pattern is distinct on the basis of the apparent molecular weights of the components but corresponds in principle to the component patterns of other thermophilic sulfur archaebacteria.
