Growth occurs in media containing at least 0.2 M Mg2+ or more, with an optimum of 0.4 M.  At least 0.04 M Mg2+ is required for maintenance of native cell morphology and cell lysis occurs in NaCl solutions of less than 0.85 M.  Grows at pH 7.0–9.0 and 30– 55 ˚C, with optimum growth at pH 7.4 and 53 ˚C.
