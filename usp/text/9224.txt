strain SH-94-5 was derived from a population of nitrate assimilation-deficient cells comprising a numerically significant component of the South Harney Hot Spring microbiota at the time of collection., SH-94-5 can grow on a number of N sources, with ammonium and glutamine being the best observed substrates for growth, The doubling time of ammonium-grown SH-94-5 increased with increasing ammonium concentration over the tested range of 0.5 to 5 mM, Like many cyanobacteria, SH-94-5 can grow with urea as the sole N source, but only at rates much lower than those reported for other strains,
