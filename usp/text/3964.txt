Facultative chemolithoautotroph with an optimum pH range of 2.0 to 3.0 and an optimum temperature range of 65 to 75°C.  Strain MK1 grows optimally on pyrite or Fe(II) sorbed onto ferrihydrite, exhibiting doubling times between 10 and 11 h under aerobic conditions (65°C)_dot  Abundant in Fe(III) oxide mats at temperatures ranging from 55 to 80°C. No measurable growth in the presence of 20 mM ferrous sulfate, suggesting that sorbed Fe(II) or the presence of a mineral substrate is an important prerequisite for the growth of this organism.
