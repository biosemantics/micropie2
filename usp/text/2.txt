The cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina was found to be the only oxygenic photoautotroph that uses the pigment chlorophyll (Chl) d as the predominant photosynthetic pigment, with only trace amounts of Chl a. Although A. marina produces phycobiliproteins (PBPs), they do not form phycobilisomes (PBS), a typical structure for cyanobacterial peripheral antenna, but instead accumulate rod-shaped PBP complexes.
