tightly coiled trichomes, halotolerant, Cyanobacteria with tightly coiled trichomes are frequently found in thermal freshwater environments as well as in brackish, marine and hypersaline waters, Under favourable conditions they can form dense benthic populations and make major contributions to primary productivity., they are traditionally considered cosmopolitan micro-organisms with remarkable capabilities to acclimatize to broad ranges of environmental conditions, euryhaline cyanobacteria, from hypersaline waters, contained phycocyanin, Halotolerant, euryhaline cyanobacteria with trichomes coiled into a tight, closed helix, able to grow at salinities between 3 and 13 % or above, but not at freshwater salinities.
