It is an obligate chemorganotroph and grows preferentially on proteolysis products such as yeast, beef extract, tryptone, peptone, and casein hydrolysate, and also grows on a mixture of ten essential amino acids (arginine, aspartic acid, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, threonine, tyrosine, and valine).
