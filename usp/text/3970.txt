Poor or modest growth was observed on other sulfide minerals, including sphalerite (ZnS) and covellite (CuS); however, no growth was observed on aqueous sulfide, thiosulfate, or tetrathionate or on the reduced Fe minerals magnetite (Fe3O4) and siderite (FeCO3)_dot  Anaerobic growth was not detected using SËš as an electron donor and ferric iron (as ferrihydrite) as an electron acceptor.
