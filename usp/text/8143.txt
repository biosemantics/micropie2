In the presence of H2 (and nitrate or thiosulfate), supplementation with yeast extract, meat extract, peptone, tryptone, casein, gelatine, casamino acids, raffinose, or formate did not influence growth, while acetate, citrate, pyruvate, glucose, or starch strongly inhibited or even prevented growth (at 0.1% w/v).
