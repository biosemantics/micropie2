Collectively, the nutritional, antigenic, and genomic characteristics of strains 161, 162, and 163 clearly indicate their unique taxonomic status as compared with anaerobic mycoplasmas of the genus Anaeroplasma and with sterol non-requiring facultatively anaerobic mollicutes of the family Acholeplasmataceae.
