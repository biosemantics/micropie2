RFLP patterns which are similar to those characteristics of other serovars of the parvo biovar but differ from those characteristics of the emended U. urealyticum; amplification by PCRs for parvo biovarspecific nucleotide sequences for the urease-associated genes, the 16S rRNA genes, the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic regions, and the 5' end of the genes of the multiple-banded antigens, and the parvo biovarspecific RAPD PCR.
