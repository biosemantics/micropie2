Initially designated Asterococcus mycoides (Borrel et al., 1910), referring to its pleomorphic, mucous nature and to the production of mycelium-like filaments, the nomenclature of this taxon was modified to Mycoplasma mycoides when it acquired the legitimate genus name Mycoplasma (Edward & Freundt, 1956), as listed on the Approved Lists of Bacterial Names that became effective in January 1980 (Skerman et al., 1980).
