Genomes ranging from 840 to 1140 kbp which demonstrate >70% hybridization patterns with DNA of other strains of the present T960 biovar of ureaplasmas; RFLP patterns similar to those of other serovars of the T960 biovar but which differ from those characteristic of the proposed U. parvum; amplification with PCRs for T960 biovarspecific nucleotide sequences for the urease-associated genes, the 16S rRNA genes, the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic regions, and the 5'-end of the genes of the multiple-banded antigens, and T960-specific randomly amplified polymorphic DNA PCR.
