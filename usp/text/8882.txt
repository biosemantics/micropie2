Cyanobacteria with tightly coiled trichomes are frequently found in thermal freshwater environments as well as in brackish, marine and hypersaline waters, Under favourable conditions they can form dense benthic populations and make major contributions to primary productivity, On the basis of the tightness of the helix, thin cross-walls (invisible by light microscopy) and several ultrastructural features, they are morphologically distinguished from a variety of other cyanobacteria with more loosely helical or sinuous trichomes, Marine strains were somewhat variable with respect to salinity optima and tolerances.
