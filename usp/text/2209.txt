The polar lipids were phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate methyl ester, phosphatidylglycerol sulfate and eight glycolipids; three of these glycolipids (GL3, GL4 and GL5) were chromatographically identical to S-DGD-1 (sulfated mannosyl glucosyl diether 1), TGD-1 (galactosyl mannosyl glucosyl diether 1) and DGD-1 (mannosyl glucosyl diether 1), respectively.
