The colonies are red-colored, circular with entire margin, convex and shiny with a diameter of 0.5-1.0 mm after incubating 5 days on complex agar medium at 37°C.  Growth occurs at temperatures ranging from 17 to 45°C (optimum, 30-37°C), in the presence of 15-30% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 23-25%), and in the pH range 7.0 to 8.5 (optimum, pH 7.5).
