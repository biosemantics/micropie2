The type strain, TS2T (=NBRC 101555T=JCM 13640T= DSM 17994T), was isolated from hot water emitted from a casing pipe driven into a hydrothermal site at Suiyo Seamount (28˚ 34’ N 140˚ 38’ E) at a depth of 1380 m.  Casamino acids (supplemented with glutamine, asparagine and tryptophan), starch, sucrose, maltose, glucose, citrate, lactate and acetate, did not support the growth.
