MicroPIE
=========================================


Introduction
====================
MicroPIE (Microbial Phenomics Information Extractor) is a text mining tool that utilizes domain experts' knowledge, NLP and machine learning techniques to extract phenomic characters from microbial descriptions. MicroPIE is part of an NSF funded research project entitled AVAToL: Next Generation Phenomics for the Tree of Life (NSF DEB #1208256).
MicroPIE 0.1.0 can cope with 42 characters, including G+C, Cell shape, Cell diameter, Cell length, Cell width, Cell relationships&aggregations, Gram stain type, External features, Internal features, Motility, Pigment compounds, Salinity preference, NaCl minimum, NaCl optimum, NaCl maximum, pH minimum, pH optimum, pH maximum, Temperature minimum, Temperature optimum, Temperature maximum, Aerophilicity, Magnesium requirement for growth, Vitamins and Cofactors required for growth, Antibiotic sensitivity, Antibiotic resistant, Colony shape , Colony margin, Colony texture, Colony color, Fermentation Products, Other Metabolic Product, Pathogenic, Disease caused, Pathogen target Organ, Haemolytic&haemadsorption properties, organic compounds used or hydrolyzed, organic compounds not used or not hydrolyzed, inorganic substances used, inorganic substances not used, fermentation substrates used, fermentation substrates not used.

Configuration Instruction
====================
MicroPIE is an open source application. The source codes are organized with Maven.
